<h1>Peru, A Land of Contrasts</h1>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Any</span> statement regarding Peru implies a contrary statement equally valid.
Contrast is its characteristic quality, true as to the general aspects
of the country and ramifying through remote details. It is the obvious
point of view from which to study Peru.</p>

<p>The three parts of this book&mdash;the desert, the mountains, the jungle&mdash;are
the three natural divisions of the country. The shore is a long, narrow
desert, much diversified. In a fertile valley intersecting it lies Lima,
The City of the Kings. The river has come from the Andes, on whose lofty
tablelands, called <i>jalca</i> in the north and <i>puna</i> in the south,
flourished remote civilizations filled with mystery. Beyond the mountain
barrier lies the jungle, geographically the largest portion of Peru,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span>
and like all other jungles a region of dread and fascination.</p>

<p>Peru is a low country lying under a mild sky; but above are the mighty
Andes freezing under arctic blizzards. The desert is barren for lack of
rain; beyond the mountains, the over-productive jungle is saturated with
tropical downpours. Along the shore thunder-storms are unknown; up on
the icy tablelands of the cordillera, whose volcanoes are sealed with
snow, lightning rips open the mountainsides. Fire splits, and water
smooths. Mists are strong enough to magnify and the sky is clear enough
to do so. The <i>puna</i> is a land of brutal elements, yet there is found
the little chinchilla, protected with softest fur.</p>

<p>On the coast, overhead calm is counterbalanced by subterranean fury.
“All geological phenomena are still in active operation,” the shore
rising, earthquakes changing the face of the earth, and underground
rivers dodging beneath a desert sterile for want of the water which they
are hurrying off. The people who live in this country of volcanoes and
earthquakes feed on red peppers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span></p>

<p>If lack of water prevents the heat of the sun from making the desert
productive, so cold prevents water upon the mountain plains from
encouraging vegetation. In the jungle luxuriance of all growth conceals
any single benefit. Nature erects barriers everywhere. She has
surrounded her richest gifts with almost insurmountable difficulties.
Fertilizers come from the desert, a realm of death. Mines of the Andes
coldly hoard their riches under a life-sucking atmosphere. Agassiz said:
“An empire might esteem itself rich in any one of the sources of
industry which abound in the Amazon valley.” But these are inaccessible
from their very quantity, and they shut in beneath them a fever-laden
air. Where there is most fertilizer, the land is most barren; where
there are most precious metals, it is most incapable of supporting human
life; where richest, it is most difficult to cultivate.</p>

<p>Such is Peru. Elements and forces contrast; each combats each, and all
attack man. Nature wars against herself: tropic heat, arctic cold;
heavy, poisonous jungle mists, thin air of the mountain-tops; scorching
dryness, reeking wet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span> Even obstacles contrast in Peru. Man is
threatened everywhere by elements, by insects. He drowns here or dies of
thirst there. He can even be overcome by cold or sunstroke in the same
place.</p>

<p>Peru is a land of violent extremes. It has a range of mountains as great
as any in the world. The towering peaks are too high to climb. Far above
circles the condor, the largest bird in the world. Peru is the source of
the world’s greatest river system, whose luxuriant forests are too thick
to penetrate. The only representatives of a lost geological age inhabit
them, as well as the biggest snakes and the smallest birds. Peru has
great mineral deposits in the mountains; it also has rubber in the
forests. Wool is produced on the frozen plains, and chocolate in the
deep gorges lost among them. And from the valleys intersecting the
desert come cotton and sugar-cane.</p>

<p>All kinds of obscure substances are found in this versatile country,
ipecac and cochineal, cocaine and vanadium. Not unlike the rest of the
world, chill here produces fever, but quinine, the best remedy for the
disease of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span> contrast, comes also from the forests of Peru.</p>

<p>Although nature is a supreme fact, its natural history is not the whole
of Peru. And contrast as a method of interpretation does not fail for
its other aspects. Though man seems to play so small a part, he has
lived here since antediluvian animals wandered among coal forests on the
Andes. To the charm of limitless nature is added the mystery of great
peoples destroyed before they were known. The riches of the Incas and of
the glittering, vice-regal Spanish days, when continents were found,
taken, and explored, contrast with present poverty. Consistently
throughout, the riches of Peru have impoverished it. Its gifts have
caused its ruin over and over again.</p>

<p>Wars and rebellions have riddled the country, and bull-fights have
filled leisure hours. Though audacity of action has fascinated
historians of Peru, its periods of peace have in them even more of
romance: a nation of slaves ruled by a monarch-god; oriental splendor of
Lima shining because of forced labor in the dark, suffocating mines;
Arab blood in the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span>querors’ veins penetrating the quiet Indian
people, adding a keener edge to their sufferings. The poverty of the
present-day Indians contrasts with lavish nature, “beggars sitting on a
pile of gold.” Contrasts of nature, of people to country, of antiquity
to the present&mdash;these diverse elements are insistent wherever one turns.</p>

<p>The charm of contrasting facts is puissant. Almost any one of them might
be the text for an allegory. To guard against rhapsody, I have
documented every statement made. Conservative authority can be given for
every fact, however fantastic, however trivial. The few legends are in a
sense also facts: “<i>Une légende ment parfois moins qu’un document.</i>”</p>

<p>The tellers of Peru’s story deserve a history themselves. First came the
falcon-eyed missionaries of Spain, sword and rosary clattering beneath
priestly robes, to subject the Indians to salvation, or mercifully to
condemn them to death by torture. Had they been less conscientious in
describing all those quaint beliefs and idolatrous practices which they
came to stamp out, we should perhaps have missed the chief source of
information in regard to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span> Children of the Sun and their dependent
peoples. Military writers and official chroniclers followed in close
order. It took them some time to recover from their amazement at this
land of “gold, silver and pleasant monkeys.” They wrote with convincing
emphasis, “Wee that live now at Peru ... finde not ourselves to bee
hanging in the aire, our heades downward and our feete on high.” On the
contrary, they discovered that they were even “as near unto heaven at
Peru as in Spain.”</p>

<p>Explorers and adventurers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
were in the forefront of writers of romance. Such authors have always
found inspiration here. From Marmontel to the <i>Peruvian Tales</i> of
Guenelette, from Frank Stockton to José-Maria de Heredia, chiseler of
faultless cameos, who himself came from a dramatic land of Spanish
conquest, Peru has been a word to conjure with. But invention has added
no glamour to history. It cannot keep pace with fact.</p>

<p>Accounts by various travelers of past centuries, voyages of discovery
and reports of treasure fleets are followed by the students of to-day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span>
Scientists write of Peru, each authority finding his specialty accented.
The geologist sees cosmic forces in active operation still. The
anthropologist studies untouched savages in the morasses of the Amazon,
the naturalist’s wonderland. Archeology now has an exciting preëminence.
Cool authorities admit the amazing antiquity of Peruvian ruins. The
historian finds a great barbaric civilization; the economist ancient
systems of state policy; the prospector an extensive system of navigable
waterways. The mining engineer discovers inexhaustible mines, and the
agriculturist unique opportunity, where the uplands of a farm lie among
snows, its lowlands under rubber groves and orange trees. All write of
Peru, and an increasing bibliography affords easy access to every sort
of statistics. I have referred to a wide range of authorities, many of
them cited in an appendix, to supplement my own observations, made as
member of an astronomical expedition, during a stay of several months in
Peru.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>A painstaking person while in Peru wrote a journal containing all he
saw. Not an event<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span> or an observation escaped chronicle. But on reaching
home he discovered that his really poignant memories were not in his
journal. His entries, though conscientious, “were but the ingredients.
They were not the secret of the philtre.”</p>

<p>Facts make their own appeal. But direct assault is not the only means of
approach. Sometimes subtleties are best observed by looking at something
else. It is often easier to see the beauty, the full glitter and glance
of a thing in another object, as the play of colors in the aurora
borealis is better perceived by turning the eyes aside. Sometimes one or
two minor points chosen from an embarrassment of interesting details are
all the imagination needs, as a plant selects only those elements from
air and soil which can be used in perfecting its tissue of stem and leaf
and flower.</p>

<p>It can only be hoped that this book about Peru may succeed in even
suggesting its unique appeal.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_Ia" id="CHAPTER_Ia"></a>CHAPTER I<br /><br />
ALONG SHORE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> surface of the ocean is unruffled. Only the heaving of its great
body suggests the power beneath. But when it confronts the desert
cliffs, backed by the world-weight of the Andes, the force which has
been gathering all the way from Australia, so mighty that it can be
compared to nothing but itself, snarls into uncontrolled fury,
rebellious, but acknowledging the limit of its power.</p>

<p>The “Peaceful Ocean” lies next to a land of geological unrest; the coast
rising, subterranean torment breaking out in earthquakes, hurling cliffs
into the sea. Even the busy modern port of Callao partakes of the
mystery of this elemental land. The white ships anchored in the clear
water of its harbor gradually turn dull brown. Might it be the crater of
an extinct volcano?</p>

<p>No wonder the people on such a shore build<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span> bamboo cages plastered with
refuse and mud to live in, temporary for them as the present stage is
transient in the history of the land on which they live. Their
object-lessons are warring natural forces. No wonder they are brutal,
slinging cattle on board steamers by the horns, casting a stone between
the eyes of a bullock to make him turn around. Even their little
children play at bull-fights with horns of defunct cattle. The soil of
this “sea-gnawn” shore affords not one necessity for human existence,
not even a drop of water. There are no real harbors, only niches in the
jagged coast. But few lighthouses indicate danger, and the desert is
chilled by winds from the Antarctic pole.</p>

<p>Far out, a low cloud is skimming the surface of the gray water,
advancing in waves of blackness. From one end a shower falls; at the
other, a column rises from the water to meet the on-rushing mass, “a
great oval, rolling forwards over the sea.” It comes nearer and nearer,
till the shore shimmers as through heat waves. The quiet is complete
except for the noise of millions of laboring wings.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>SEALS OF THE PALOMINOS ISLANDS.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span></p>

<p>A cloud of birds! Now they fall to the water with close-clapped wings,
hundreds at a time, each a tiny splashing fountain. Their hunger is
insatiable, but not because food is lacking, for the swarms of pilchards
beneath the waves are vaster than the armies of birds which pursue them.
Ancient Indian races enriched their irrigated fields with these little
fish. A curious, tawny jewel is found upon this shore, known as “fishes’
eyes.” Might they be fossilized eyes of those fertilizer-fishes?</p>

<p>The appearance of this coast could not have been different in
antediluvian days, with the screeching birds and the mammoth terrapin
off-shore, those associates of the dodo.</p>

<p>The birds fly out at sunrise and spend the day in fishing, resting upon
the waves when they are tired, and at sunset return to their giant stone
islands for the night. Alone, the call of a sea-bird would be lost in
the fury of the meeting of cliff and sea. But as a mass of white gulls
can assume blackness by mere quantity, so their mingled voices can take
on an overwhelming poignancy of sound. Louder than the crash of
breakers, louder than the barking and snort<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18">{18}</a></span>ing of the bald, fat seals
loping over them in droves, surges the great cry of the birds, as, in a
shower of wild calls diverse as themselves, they settle upon the rocks:
pelicans, cormorants, mollyhawks, gannets, sea-mews, gulls, osprey,
occasional tropical flamingoes lost among ice-birds and stormy petrels,
wild ducks, Inca terns, and the weird, amphibious “bird-child,” which
tries to stand erect, fluttering its cartilaginous wings, braced by its
indistinguishable tail. All the birds of the ocean gather here, from
sandpeeps to albatrosses, a surfeit of life to accentuate the barrenness
of the shore. They are multiplying every year their already limitless
myriads, useless to man as the savages of the interior, without
commercial value now of any kind, yet not annihilated on that account.
It is said that all are souls of sailors lost at sea. In each stormy
petrel a lost apprentice lives again, in each pelican a boatswain, in
each mollyhawk a chief officer, in each albatross a sturdy old captain.</p>

<p>One is tempted to write of the romance of the sea-birds of Peru, if
romance has in it any of the fascination of waste on a large scale, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span>
like barrenness, waste must be on a large scale to be picturesque. Where
is the impertinence of it so overwhelming as in nature&mdash;her spendthrift
production of unused powers, and the daring of her destruction?</p>

<p>A German scientist, investigating the guano interests, reported eleven
million birds on one of the Chincha Islands, for these are the guano
birds, and these wild, craggy islands the Guano Islands, a jewel-casket
of Peru, which now abandoned, emptied of its contents, stands wide open,
staring vacant in the sunlight, that its owners may not forget its
former fullness.</p>

<p>Under the stimulus of pure guano a plant will spring to mammoth
dimensions, lavishing blossoms and fruit. Ancient races, even the
foreign Incas, realized its magical endowments and made laws governing
its use. But land enriched by guano into immense fertility lapses after
a while, barer than before.</p>

<p>A few sailing ships, hoping to glean poor remnants of this accumulation
of the centuries, still huddle as close as possible to the black rocks,
which, because of the quantity of that very fertilizer which has
distinguished them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20">{20}</a></span> are made repellent to life of any kind. In this
laboratory of the strongest fertilizer, there is not the slightest trace
of vegetation&mdash;Peru in paradox.</p>

<p>The sunset blazes through the fissures and shoots shafts of opalescent
light under the great stone bridges toward the mountainside of the
candelabrum, veiled in a hazy shimmer. Defiantly gorgeous it is, all but
the young moon which nestles among rushing scarlet and black clouds.</p>

<p>A giant candelabrum, at least four hundred feet long, is hollowed deep
in the rock of the sheer volcanic headland above the sea. Its trenches
do not fill with drifting sand, though the natives of Pisco make
periodic pilgrimages across the bay, just to be sure. Some think it is a
sign of royalty, a flaunt of the Incas, or the boundary-mark of a
conquered kingdom. Some say it was a warning made by the Spaniards after
Pisco was sacked by English freebooters in the seventeenth century, for
though now over a mile inland, it was then a coast town. Such is the
equilibrium of the Peruvian coast! Others call it “the three crosses,”
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span> life-penance many years ago of a Franciscan friar named Guatemala.</p>

<p>But a symbol does not for mere inquiry give up the secret of its hidden
mystery. Doubtless the origin and purpose of the Candelabrum of Pisco
will never be known.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>A few small, square, purple shadows mark a town, put down at random in
the desert beside the sea. Some houses are made of the ribs and jaws of
whales. A conspicuous white building, a little removed, is for sufferers
with bubonic plague. Crosses surmount hummocks round about the town.
People are making pilgrimages to and fro. And over all, white-headed
vultures are wheeling. They spread their wings and cry in the silence.</p>

<p>Dust covers the little city, clustering about a market-place of sand. A
fountain without water mutely occupies its center. Lamp-posts without
lamps surround it, and the mud houses are without windows. The cathedral
towers have no bells. Strange plaster figures are sculptured upon the
façade, and infants with hands put on backwards hold up the portico.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span>
Beyond the door with a two-inch keyhole are Virgins in pink silk and
gold tinsel, saints with rows of parallel ribs, angels with gauze wings,
towering altars of gingerbread work, artificial flowers, and
silver-paper fringe.</p>

<p>Glossy-haired women, their black <i>mantas</i> (head-shawls) thrown back,
drag stiff skirts through the dirty sand. Half-naked children gnaw at
the inside of long bean-pods. Mangy dogs with dusty skin and a sparse
sprinkling of yellow hair slink into the shadows. Black goats and their
attenuated kids search about in the sand for something to eat. Men and
women file out of black interiors, carrying gourds full of brilliant
edibles. Meal braizes over a low fire on the sand; a woman crouching
over it whips the flame with the end of her long hair. From time to
time, to make a brighter blaze, she picks up pieces of wood with her
strong toes. Near by struts a blue-eyed bird. It is a <i>huerequeque</i>, the
household scavenger. Bits of cloth hang about his tall knees. The woman
explains that they are trousers intended to keep him warm. She is sorry
I could not have come a few days later, for she is about to make him<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span>
some new ones for summer, of lighter quality, with lace edges.</p>

<p>The market is held in the bed of a “river,” no less dry than the
surrounding desert. Old women behind piles of tropical fruits,
<i>guayabas</i>, <i>pacays</i>, <i>ciruelas</i>, gossip to a whir of small mandolins.
Heavy-browed men in flapping sombreros drink thick liquids and purchase
pats of red and yellow <i>picante</i> (a highly seasoned dish). Groups of
pack-horses with silver bridles are tied round about the market.</p>

<p>But surprises are lurking in these coast towns. Behind heavy, unexpected
doors, the single affluent family of the town receives in a peacock-blue
salon. There is a lady in brown, with trimmings of blue velvet and
cotton lace, and a perpendicular yellow hat. Another is in purple
velvet, with swan’s-down hat and photograph brooch of her sister. A
third, wearing green velvet, a salmon colored hat with red roses, and
holding a pink silk handkerchief embroidered in lavender, sits purring
beside her red-faced German fiancé. The carpet is red, the furniture
covered with brown brocade; there are statues of carved alabaster with
gilt<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span> edges and pink cuspidors. Gold mirrors, chromos of Venetian court
life, and pasteboard calendars of bygone years hang upon the walls. The
Spanish tiles of long ago are painted over.</p>

<p>Farther up the street a door may open upon a wilderness of vicuña rugs
as tawny as a lion and softer than moleskin. Shawls of tan-colored wool,
silkier than Liberty fabrics, lie about. One is not surprised that
vicuña wool was reserved for royal use in Inca days, nor that blankets
of it were sent by the conquerors as offerings to Philip II. There are
little foot-warmers made of vicuña fur and chinchilla skins, wiry
penguin skins and a deafening noise of singing birds in cages. A
black-eyed girl with hair like tarred rope stands making <i>cazuela</i> (a
thick soup) and paring guavas. She claps her hands, and many doves fly
in to peck the crumbs from her lips.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IIa" id="CHAPTER_IIa"></a>CHAPTER II<br /><br />
DESERT QUALITY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A certain</span> herb lives for years underground in the desert; it feels no
necessity for a leaf-existence. Yet if the parched roots are reached by
water, they expand toward the sun in lovely bloom.</p>

<p>Up from the shore stretches the bare immensity of desert, ending in one
tremulous horizon with the ocean, and with the wilderness of mountains
against the pulsating sky at the other. It is the Land of Light. All
sensation of color is lost in this great sensation of light, an ardent
light “shining through things, not on them.” Even the clouds expire from
excess of light. It reduces all colors to mere hot vibration. The
translucent mountains swim in a sea of light, reflecting from it as from
wide stretches of water. Though sensation of color is lost in light,
their huge forms are distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26">{26}</a></span> in the radiant atmosphere, but unreal as
if half-veiled.&mdash;One attribute of mirage is absolute clearness of
outline.&mdash;Insignificant details emerge, but they rouse admiration only
because of the light investing them.</p>

<p>The whole wide desert culminates in illusion and mystery of distant
outlines. Everything floats in it, as it sweeps over from the opalescent
mountains. A cross in the midst of the shelly sand, “protruding through
thin layers of mirage,” marks the spot where a greatly feared bandit was
killed. Skulls are heaped beneath it, with matches and half-burned
candles.</p>

<p>Water being denied, the desert is soaked with sun. It is the Land of
Heat. No plant grows in the scorching soil, no animal can endure it. No
bird, no insect flies through the burning atmosphere. Each object
shimmers until it seems but the reflection of itself. Fire descends from
the burnished sky and vibrates in the air and scalds the sand. Yet
concentrating a tropical sun, this hot solitude lies between the cold
ocean and the mountains, a region of ice.</p>

<p>This desert is the abode of weird phenomena. Sometimes a globe of fire
springs to the size of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span> the sun, illuminating the sky for a quarter of
an hour; then it dissipates into an infinitude of stars, which wriggle
off into bright little tails and disappear.</p>

<p>A slowly moving company, muffled to the eyes, with heads done up like
Tuaregs of the Sahara, mincing across the desert on donkeys, suddenly
see themselves swinging along over their own heads, as if magnified by a
gigantic mirror in the sky. The clouds give back strange pictures of
one’s self enlarged and surrounded by a halo or a circular iris,
summoning a saint or revealing a fairy. This quality is inherent in
Peru, making ordinary moments ornamental.</p>

<p>Near Casma is a hill called “Dreadful,” whose continuous sandslides when
the heat is greatest give off a sound of mystery, suggesting heat, like
the roar of a distant volcano.</p>

<p>No matter how much the political status of Peru may change from century
to century, it remains always the lair of earthquakes. Mines of gold and
silver, islands of guano, deserts of nitrate, may be in turn discovered,
exploited, exhausted. Earthquakes destroy those who have been enriched
as those who have lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span> beside them in want. Even now earthquakes are
almost daily recurrent along the coast. In laying your ear to the ground
you can hear subterranean rumblings. Only in the frequency of slight
shocks do people feel secure; otherwise they know the underground world
is hoarding strength for a fury of destruction. As a traveler of the old
time expressed it: “The inhabitants are subject to being buried in the
ruins of their own houses at any time.”</p>

<p>The Indians say that when God rises from His throne to review the human
race, each step as He progresses is an earthquake. As soon as they feel
the pressure of His foot upon the earth, they rush from their huts to
show themselves to Him. When the rumbling becomes loud enough to be
noticeable, dogs howl, beasts of burden stop and spread their legs to
secure themselves from falling, people rush to doorways, and churches
are emptied in an instant. Reddish mists steam from the sea, bad odors
from the earth; distant thunder&mdash;complete wind-stillness. The clouds of
sea-birds rise from the earth and fly high, watching an agony in which
they have no part. Then a frightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span> crash, rocks are torn asunder,
great masses fall off as islands into the sea, which is still. But soon
it turns black, boiling with a smell of sulphur, and many dead fish
float about.</p>

<p>Omnipresent, the earthquake is a mystery which no laws can govern,
beyond man’s comprehension or control. One never gets accustomed to it.
Horror at a first shock only increases with further experience.
Earthquake is linked with freaks of nature; it lifts up a ridge across
the bed of a stream; it alters the face of the earth so that lawsuits
spring up over changed boundaries. It vitiates the soil. Blooming fields
wither, crops are lost, and cattle die from eating the scorched grass.
The fiery core of earth is nearer the cooled surface than we imagine.
But here at least there are no “torments from heaven.” In Peru it is
said that lightning is worse than earthquake, emanating as it does from
God’s own realm.</p>

<p>Even the climate of the coast partakes of mystery. The clouds hurrying
from the Atlantic have drenched a whole continent of jungle in tropical
downpour, and before they reach the desert, their last drop of moisture
has<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span> been wrested from them as snow&mdash;drained dry by the Andes. The
tropical sun heats, and the Antarctic current bringing its icy winds,
cools. Sometimes one predominates, sometimes the other. For the red-hot
desert can also be cold! The low-hanging <i>garuas</i>, the ocean mists of
half a year, chill the desert and cling to the base of the mountains,
fading lighter and lighter up and away from the black rocks where white
surf is breaking. Such are the facts of the case, but it has been
thought that the original god, Con, was responsible, for once in anger
he deprived this desert coast of rain.</p>

<p>The desert is majestically empty, a great “vision of nothing without
perspective.” Yet its mere emptiness suggests breadth, backward and
forward, up and down, both in time and space. An unheard silence lies
between the empty horizons, perfect except for the “great, faint sound
of breakers,” the tumble of an unused ocean of water, which destroys
without moistening the desert shores.</p>

<p>It seems lifeless. Harmless and peaceful at least, it presents nothing
to be destroyed by sun-blight. It remains, as it apparently always<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">{31}</a></span> has
been, the realm of death&mdash;though even death presupposes life before it.
But disturb the desert, and a thousand forces spring into action,
furiously attacking the intruder. The heat of the sun assumes a ghoulish
love of destruction, and at night the stars look down upon a creature
shivering with fever, reeking with wet in this desert place. Possessing
all fruitful ingredients within and kindly elements without, the desert
sleeps. It needs only one thing to burst into life.</p>

<p>A mysterious river springs forth full-grown. From what glacier or clear,
icy fountain up on the frozen <i>puna</i> may it not have issued? And then,
after a mysterious incubation, it returns to sparkle here in the light,
and in the leaves and flowers which the dampened earth is ready to
produce.</p>

<p>There are traditions that sometimes a vagrant shower escapes from the
magnetism of the mountain-tops. The flowers waiting just beneath the
surface spring up like bloom over the June earth. The water was a shower
of bluebells! A fugitive vegetation greedily spreads, quickly as it
disappears with the pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span>ing of the water. In some places cotton grows
to the height of a horse’s head, a luxuriant crop, too unexpected for
harvest. This brilliant life lasts a week, perhaps more, and then
lapses. Where do the slumbering flowers conceal themselves? Where,
indeed, does the pansy get its coloring matter?</p>

<p>The desert of Peru is varied: toward the south the coast is strewn with
borax, white upon the cliffs; toward the north petroleum gushes from
beneath it. Upon the red plains of Huacho are the salt lakes of Pampa
Pelada, reflecting the sun in a thousand colors. “White dust-whirlpools
dance on its white floor.” Its banks are scattered with the bones of
animals which have come there for salt, and its perpendicular cliffs are
haunted by flesh-eating birds. There, gnarled gray shrubs “loom as if
carved out of clay.” Beyond, the desert is coated with nitrate; yet here
it seems but pulverized bones, beneath acres of white skeletons bleached
by a thousand years&mdash;gaunt testimony to its desertdom since prehistoric
Indian races struggled to make it blossom.</p>

<p>In the Pampa of Islay the desert takes on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">{33}</a></span> terra-cotta hue. Whirlwinds
progress from hollow to hollow. Above the purple mountains, shading away
from the red desert, bright blue peaks are snow-covered to set them off
from the sky. Fog shadows drop darkness here and there over their
barrenness. Even the mist has a poetry of contrast.</p>

<p>Across the plain a constant ocean wind sweeps fine white beach-sand
along with waves of color, no less real because impalpable. Its
pilgrimage of a thousand years toward the mountains is uninterrupted,
for the wind blows always from the southwest. It causes the rippled
waves of sand which it brings along to assume in traveling a crescent
shape&mdash;the wandering <i>médanos</i>.</p>

<p>Sometimes larger dunes overtake smaller ones, which, so absorbed, become
firmer in shape as they journey toward the mountains. Should two
collide, they are shivered, then blend in a new crescent, usually to
separate again.</p>

<p>Growing from a network of roots within the moving dune, the snowy heads
of a small plant maintain themselves just above the sand as it drifts
over the hard plateau.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34">{34}</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>médanos</i> are scattered as thickly as the crescent shadows of some
vast eclipse, a labyrinth of nature. They are as mysterious as
“mushrooms growing in rings, marsh-fires which cannot warm, or the
shrinking of the sensitive plant.”</p>

<p>The sand drops constantly over the acute crest. From all about come soft
sounds, an overwhelming minor music, almost inaudible. Were you in a
forest, you might think it was the soughing of the wind through the
branches or the shuffle of locusts devouring a tree.</p>

<p>These playthings of the wind have been called symbols of the Moon in the
land of the Sun, since nothing in Inca days could dissociate itself from
either; a crescent Moon humbled by the Sun’s anger, allowed to possess
her former fullness but a day at a time, doomed to be obliterated over
and over again.</p>

<p>The worth of anything consists in the fact that through it can be seen
something more beautiful than itself, something to which it forms the
setting. Words are mere points of departure. What limitless excursions
can even one word suggest, into countries more wonderful</p>

<p class="nind">than any created by a remote if consummate artist! And what an intimate
happiness is found there, which no one else has felt nor could describe
if he had!</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>Wherever rivers descend from the mountains, green garlands are slung
across the desert. No wonder the river was a god to the desert-dweller,
bringing with it meadows and gardens. Where only dust has been, acres of
cotton, bright-green sugar-fields, and dark orchards lie between mud
walls and willow-shaded lanes. Herds graze upon alfalfa steaming in the
sun. The yellow plaster terraces and balconies of <i>haciendas</i> among
their banana groves are shaded by cascades of glowing bougainvillea. But
wherever water is, fever follows. Disease clings to the green spaces.
Even sickness cannot abide in the desert alone.</p>

<p>Huge, pyramid-like mud structures spring crumbling from the soil whose
modified form they seem to be, temples and palaces of former days, each
with its legend. The ruins are inhabited by weird iguanas and “haunted
by those birds of ill omen that only nest in ruins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36" id="page_36">{36}</a></span>” Mounds of
treasure, too, linger along the desert, and fragments of the paved road
of the Incas.</p>

<p>A gold bell was once buried in Tambo de Mora. Older people have heard it
tolling on quiet nights. Some say it rings from the top of a hill, some,
from beneath the ground. To be sure, bells were not known to ancient
Peruvians, yet a company was properly financed to hunt for this bell of
gold.</p>

<p>Submerged or enchanted cities exist on every hand. A mystic race of
dwarfs live in the Andes. They guard a vault of buried treasure. An
Indian who declared he had seen it became so terrified at the extent of
the riches that he fled, not forgetting to mark his path. Yet frequently
as he had followed the trail to the very spot, he could never again find
the cavern of glittering jewels: it had sunk completely out of
sight&mdash;“You can see for yourself, Señorita, that it has, if I take you
there!”</p>

<p>Legends of prehistoric days take on the garb of myth, when giants came
over the sea to Peru long before the memory of man. Wishing to provide
themselves with water in the desert, they excavated enormously deep
wells, still<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span> undeniable evidence of their dominion. Moreover, their
bones of incredible size have been found. Garcilasso says a piece of one
hollow tooth weighs more than half a pound. Their footprints have been
traced as far as Patagonia. For their sin they were destroyed by a rain
of fire.</p>

<p>Maui, too,&mdash;the Polynesian god who caught the sun with cords of cocoanut
fiber, who lifted the sky and smoothed its arched surface with his stone
adze, who made the earth habitable for man and then created him, and who
now divides his time between fishing for islands with a hook which is
called the Plume of Beauty, and resting in the form of a small day-fly
upon the under side of a flower,&mdash;Maui, who belongs to the length and
breadth of the Pacific, once visited Peru.</p>

<p>Upon this coast lived aborigines with flat noses, fishing from boats of
inflated sealskins, and sleeping pell-mell in sealskin huts on heaps of
seaweed, “tall, cannibalistic fishermen ... who used bone utensils, made
primitive pottery, nets, and fabrics of osier.”</p>

<p>Here lived the contemporaries of the Incas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38">{38}</a></span> Yuncas they were called,
“dwellers in the hot lowlands,” distinct from those of the highlands,
with their hideous thoughts painted on earthenware jars, and their hazy
conception of a single god, their pragmatic worship of him by means of
anything which he had made for their support and comfort, and their
sacrifice to him of his greatest gift, human beings.</p>

<p>Fancy is free to play along geologic or human history. Bones of
mastodons as well as sea-bottom shells are found in the desert. Vanished
races have embellished it in passing. Man has but added to the mystery
of nature. Yet after such lapses of time the two are mingled
indistinguishably.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39" id="page_39">{39}</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IIIa" id="CHAPTER_IIIa"></a>CHAPTER III<br /><br />
DESERT PERSPECTIVE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once a mine of gold in Peru. Later it became a copper mine,
and now they sell the water that collects in the bottom.</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Incas found a rainless desert intersected by fruitful valleys as
to-day, each independent, with its own gods, its own king, its own
manners and customs, even its own diseases! Each valley chieftain lived
upon a platform among the fields, but his villagers lived in the desert,
not to encroach upon land capable of cultivation. These Yuncas excelled
in the arts of weaving, fashioning metals, and in making pottery.</p>

<p>In the name of the Sun the Incas descended from regions of snow to
conquer the desert-dweller, with lofty disregard of the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">{40}</a></span> the
benign source of all blessings among the high table-lands was the
scourge of the lowlands, where water-gods were worshipped. These
religious wars changed the face of the country. Valleys were connected
by a great highway. Sun temples and convents for the Virgins of the Sun
supplanted the shrine of each valley’s chief god. Only one remained
inviolate on the whole coast, that of the awful, intangible Pachacamac,
who, being a fish-god in his great red temple by the sea, was not an
idol, but the Invisible, Unknown, Omnipotent God, who had existed before
either the sea or the sun; Pachacamac, he who formed the world out of
nothing, the Creator whose image they dared not conceive. His name was
mentioned with shrugging of shoulders and lifting up of hands, and he
was served with fasting. Unlike Sun-ritual, his cult was a personal one,
the inner worship of a people who paid tribute to golden fishes. The
Maker of all Things had been conceived by those ancient peoples who,
Balboa says, came from the north on a fleet of rafts, when the mountains
had the climate of the valleys, and the whole actual coast was under the
ocean.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span></p>

<p>The aura of the Unknown God invested the fish-idol, and the temple was
held in such awe that it was not only spared by the Incas, but they even
made pilgrimages to the shrine. Shy in the thought of offending the
Maker of the World, Inca Yupanqui allowed his golden seaside temple to
remain, but erected a temple to the Sun a little above its level. To
honor the conqueror, the priests of Pachacamac “appointed a solemn
fishing of many thousand Indians, who went to sea in their vessels of
reeds.”</p>

<p>Though the fish-idols were ejected, and a convent for the Virgins of the
Sun was founded, worship of Pachacamac went on as before. The Incas
joined in it, identifying him with Uiracocha of the mountains, but they
extorted Sun adoration as well, a fair barter of faith.</p>

<p>Then the priests of the Sun made an idol of Pachacamac, and so it
presided until, drenched with sacrificial blood, it was chopped to
pieces by Hernando Pizarro and twenty soldiers in January, 1533. A
terrible earthquake followed, which Pizarro called the devil’s rage, and
triumphant he planted a cross above the looted temple. Pizarro gave the
golden nails<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42" id="page_42">{42}</a></span> to his pilot, as a reward for his entire venture. But much
of the temple’s treasure is said to be concealed underground,
undiscovered to this day.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>The temple pile glows against the blue sea in the midst of shimmering
sand. Pachacamac lies in its magnificent ruin surrounded by acres of
skeletons. For more than two thousand years it was the most famous
burial place of the coast. Even mummies were brought from great
distances to lie in the sacred ground.</p>

<p>Layers upon layers of succeeding generations have all yielded their
excavated secrets, each throwing light on others. Time and
treasure-seekers have laid bare the most recent. Histories of great
peoples told by their graves!</p>

<p>I stood upon the summit of the broad mound, the temple to Inti, the Sun,
built by the Incas above that of Pachacamac, the fish-god. Its crumbling
walls, with traces of their brilliant coloring, ended abruptly in
mid-air. The headless skeletons of forty-six young girls had recently
been found upon the terrace where I stood, the braided cords hanging
loosely about their skeleton necks.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>PAMPA DE LOS HUESOS&mdash;THE FIELD OF BONES.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_43" id="page_43">{43}</a></span></p>

<p>Far below stretched the vast field of the dead. I looked out over a
desert of round white skulls, with eye-cavities staring at the
sun&mdash;Sun-worship continued in death. Little flurries of dust rose here
and there, as men with shovels turned over the sand, hoping for
treasure. <i>Gallinazos</i>, hideous vultures of the desert, paced up and
down. Below the convent of the Virgins of the Sun, whose niches only
remain, was a small blue lagoon under palm trees. On its reed-edges a
white heron tilted about&mdash;a curious, gnarled creature, giving an
impression of majestic grace.</p>

<p>Between me and the sand-hills rolling up to the Andes lay the silent
courts, the great, roofless houses of the city of the dead caving in
over its streets of sand. The desert-river separated this sepulchral
spot from the valley of Lurin, where cotton-fields and yellowish
expanses of sugar-cane were divided by willow hedgerows, with glimpses
of water beneath tall mud gateways. The breeze was as sweet as
heliotrope hedges could make it and filled with tinkling bird notes.</p>

<p>On the other side was the whole reach of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_44" id="page_44">{44}</a></span> the sparkling Pacific, with
its far-off sound of breakers. There is a tradition that the two rocky
islands are a goddess, Cavillaca, who cast herself and her child into
the sea a thousand years ago. But scientists assure us that the islands
were torn away by an earthquake since Spanish occupation. The Incas,
they say, had a temple on the islands, then a promontory.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>He has not beheld the quintessence of all human suffering who has not
seen the face of a hunchback child-mummy. Upon such bodies, doubled up
and tied securely into the smallest possible space, whose varnished skin
is stretched over their unbending bones, even the tattoo marks still
show in designs of their owners’ choosing. They are clothed in
finely-woven garments, with sandals, pouches, shell and bead ornaments,
embroidered bands, and hair not yet unbraided. Sometimes brilliant eyes
stare from empty sockets in the withered mummy-faces, eyes of
prehistoric cuttlefish, a symbol of fish worship. In some of the skulls
are dents made by blunted points of stone weapons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_45" id="page_45">{45}</a></span></p>

<p>One mummy sits in the attitude of a toper about to drink, with a monkey
on his shoulder&mdash;for pets of the dead man accompanied him on his
journey, his dog or parrot sometimes mummified at his feet. The men have
their slings and fish nets, the women their spindles, needles of cactus
thorns, and every implement of household use, the children their
earthenware dolls. All have their little gods and talismans. There are
pots of provisions, too, with lids to keep out the thin finger of time,
jugs of <i>chicha</i> (a beverage distilled from maize), and ears of corn in
nets from which they have never been removed since they were put in by
hands turned to dust a thousand years ago.</p>

<p>From the grave of an apparently great official with his treasure-jars,
was taken only the mummy of a puma, yellow feathers on its head, a gold
plate in its mouth, gold and silver bangles on its legs. It had a
necklace of emeralds from the north, and its tail was full of golden
feathers from the mystic jungle beyond the mountains.</p>

<p>Recently X-rays have been applied to mummy-bundles, which show other
skeletons<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46">{46}</a></span> within as well as the one who had died, skeletons of those
who, when those winding-sheets were adjusted, were still alive. Gruesome
sacrifice!</p>

<p>Pachacamac has furnished museums all over the world and is still one of
the most inexhaustible of mummy supplies.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>My horse descended carefully to this field of the dead. He picked his
way across stepping-stones on which pilgrims approached the lower court
of the temple where their year of penance before entering was to be
spent. A step, and there was the sound of crunching human bones. Sand
filled the skull cavities. They shattered like fragile glass as the
horse’s hoofs clattered across them toward the ruined city. The sand was
pulverized bones. Bits of cloth and pottery attracted the collector’s
eye, or a deformed or trephined skull.</p>

<p>The city walls are twenty feet thick. Their ends and their beginnings
are lost in sand. Marks of fire show here and there, and traces of
forgotten industries. Flights of stairs lead down from the tops of
walls, over which was the only entrance. The roofs were made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47">{47}</a></span> reeds
to let through necessary air and light; none were needed against rain.</p>

<p>Swallows, “dovelets of Santa Rosa,” flew over from the green valley of
Lurin. Bats and little owls, always in pairs, inhabited the ruins, and
lizards basked in the blinding light and enjoyed the quiet. Under the
cactus lying loose upon the ground there is sometimes a small black
spider whose bite takes months to cure. Its inhabitants emphasize still
further the uninhabitability of this scorching desert.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> other center of power confronted the Incas in the coast valleys, the
city of Chanchan, belonging to the Chimus.</p>

<p>In the kingdom of the Grand Chimu, Si, the Moon, was worshipped. It
appeared both by day and by night, which the sun was not able to do. The
Moon raised the tides; did such power not demand sacrifice? On special
occasions the Chimus offered to it small children wrapped in brilliant
cloths.</p>

<p>The ocean was the medium through which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span> their Moon-god chose to
demonstrate its power. As it nourished them with its fish, scattered by
the fish-god Pachacamac through its waves, they strewed white meal upon
its surface as a form of worship; incidentally to attract a large catch
of fish. Ni, the Ocean, symbolized water, the greatest need of a desert
land. It was also their only means of communication between the desert
valleys, as they plied up and down upon the “silent highway” to collect
tribute. Their boats were made of reeds tied together, and they sat upon
them as on “horseback, cutting the waves of the sea, and rowing with
small reeds on either side,” as Father Acosta explains. Sometimes they
had square sails of grass. One may see these boats of bulrushes upon the
shore, for they are still in use, their long, curved beaks leaning
against each other like stacks of mammoths’ tusks.</p>

<p>The water cult of the Chimu included worship of fountains, flowing
streams, and of their goddess, “She of the Emerald Skirts.” The worst
criminal was a water thief, he who turned the stream aside from his
neighbor’s field; and the Grand Chimu was overcome at last only<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">{49}</a></span> because
the Inca was able to cut off his water supply. Mild Tupac Inca Yupanqui,
who ruled the mountains as the Grand Chimu controlled the coast,
preferred victory without bloodshed, since his were religious wars to
spread the worship of the Sun.</p>

<p>Sun-worshippers and Moon-worshippers, living side by side, struggled in
mortal conflict, but the Sun-worshippers prevailed; and when, after a
few generations, the Spaniards, eager for bloodshed, came to conquer the
Sun-worshippers in the name of Christianity, the great city of the
worshippers of Moon and Sea was gone. They could glut their desire only
on hidden treasure in sepulchral mounds.</p>

<p>Mochica, the language of the Chimus, was so difficult that no grown
person could learn it. Here and there it was spoken as late as the
seventeenth century, and to-day near Eten, “where the sun halted at his
rising,” there are elements of it left in a curious dialect, spoken by a
little community of Indians whom no one can understand. They braid
Panama hats of finest straw. Their huts are almost without furniture,
they wear no shoes, and dress always<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50" id="page_50">{50}</a></span> in mourning; but they wear flowers
in their hair.</p>

<p>An Augustinian prior, Calancha, collected traditions of Chanchan, that
great city of the Chimus which covered twenty square miles. He tells of
the processions to the Moon temple, when the Grand Chimu, wearing the
jeweled diadem, in robes of feather-mosaic as fine as warp and woof, was
carried in his litter by courtiers, surrounded by musicians, minstrels,
priests, and warriors with lances and long waving plumes.</p>

<p>The mounds scattered in fragments through the desert were terraced
pyramids in those days, the walls upholding them brilliantly painted and
richly embossed. Traces can still be seen of their paintings of wild
birds and animals, and step-patterns like the pyramids themselves. Vines
of the passion-flower drooped their fruit over the garden walls upon the
terraces, for water ran to the very top. Even the avenues of trees had
individual nourishment from the distant mountains through a lofty
aqueduct, the most amazing accomplishment of an amazing people. In the
labyrinth below<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">{51}</a></span> worked the designers, dyers, potters, weavers, and the
gold-and silver-smiths, expressing the florid taste of the Chimus.</p>

<p>These sea-worshippers, fish-worshippers, made fish-gods of gold. In
Chanchan their small fish-god has been found, worth three million
dollars. With it were gold bowls, little figures of fish, lizards,
serpents, and birds, neck and arm bands, scepters and diadems, and
emeralds from the north. The larger fish-god is yet to be discovered.
Manuscripts describe conscientious attempts to unearth it.</p>

<p>The race has vanished; vast Chanchan is gone. We are not even sure what
this great people called themselves. Their gold and silver ornaments
have long ago been melted into European coin. Traditions of their wealth
and magnificence came only through their conquerors, who themselves had
no written language. Were we to believe only Inca tradition, all the
Yuncas of the coast were savages, given up to unnatural sin. Fortunately
there are vestiges of their pyramids and labyrinthine interiors of their
temples and palaces, bits of their pottery, and patterns of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52" id="page_52">{52}</a></span>
cotton fabrics. There are, too, fragments of their marvelous irrigation
system, a dumb reminder to Peru that present needs were once supplied by
the intelligence and industry of an Indian civilization.</p>

<p>A bush with many-colored clusters of flowers joined together like a
bunch of grapes grows not far from the site of Chanchan. It is said that
each flower has a different shape as well as a different color. The name
of the bush is the “Flower of Paradise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_53" id="page_53">{53}</a></span>”</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IVa" id="CHAPTER_IVa"></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><br />
PICA, THE FLOWER OF THE SAND</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A towering</span>, scoop-topped wagon, fruit-filled, dragged by nine mules,
lurched through the desert. Far in the distance, on the first low
swelling of the mighty chain of the Andes, there was a faint dark line
whence it came.</p>

<p>The driver of the wagon handed me a small branch of a <i>chirimoya</i> tree.
The three narrow, fleshy lobes of the <i>chirimoya</i> flower lie close
together among the pale green foliage and send forth a perfume as
poignant, though faint, as if there were rain-drops for conductors. The
aromatic, gently acid flesh of its fruit lies in rays, the exquisite
scent of the flower tasted in the fruit. Warmed by the sun on its
journey from the valley oasis, the whole freshness of the desert was
condensed in this single flavor, like the crystallization of a perfect
moment. Strange imaginings sprang from tasting it.</p>

<p>A gallop across the desert is a good prelude<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_54" id="page_54">{54}</a></span> to anywhere, especially if
one has silver bridle and stirrups and a long lariat with silver knobs.
The muleteers sat upon high black saddles of alpaca hair. The colors of
their mufflers must have been brilliant underneath the dust. Their
trappings were embroidered in red with a red-worsted fringe,
Inca-fashion, over the mules’ temples. Our little unshod ponies picked
their way between the stones, up hill and down, over the roadless road
to Pica.</p>

<p>The desert of Tarapacá, now belonging to Chile, is called the Plain of
the Eagle. A fit arena for gaunt battles in former days, a road across
it is now distinguishable by the bones of beasts of burden which have
dropped on their way.</p>

<p>There are valleys of nitrate to explore, hills of nitrate to be climbed,
plains of nitrate to gallop across, and the only break is one windswept
<i>tamarugo</i> tree. Does it exist upon the morning mist which the sun
disperses? Or does its tough life go on underground, like some uncouth
monster in the depth of the sea? Or does its tap-root bore down into a
deeply buried flow of water? Every one believes that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_55" id="page_55">{55}</a></span> there is a
honeycomb of tunnels from water-giving strata in the mountain-sides, far
antedating the days when Uiracocha went to Tarapacá.</p>

<p>No convulsion of nature is unknown to this pitiless land. Volcanic bombs
lie about, and fantastic heaps of lava from molten mountains mingle with
corals from the sea-bottom. Streams come to the surface, ripple for a
short distance, and disappear. Their water tastes of sulphate of soda.
Sometimes it springs suddenly from a cave, suggesting a system of
underground rivers. Sometimes it is brought by water-works of
prehistoric days, whose exact position is not known, making life
possible for their would-be destroyers. Whether freaks of nature or
remnants of the vast system of irrigation, importance enough has been
given to the underground waterways of Peru to bring a scientist from the
United States to chart them all.</p>

<p>Curious symbols and conventionalized llamas are cut into the hills of
pink trachite and black slate rock whose strata have been jostled and
overturned by earthquake. Pictures of ser<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_56" id="page_56">{56}</a></span>pents, foxes, and birds endure
through ages of merciless sun. Were they the work of a megalithic people
of a megalithic age, when cyclopean stones were transported to build
cyclopean edifices, and gigantic ant-eaters and other jungle-dwellers
swarmed in this desert of Tarapacá? Their irrefutable bones are found
here, but so are shells of the sea-bottom and water-worn stones of green
jasper with red spots. Moreover, the nitrate is filled with the
petrified eggs and bones, even the feathers of sea-birds, suggesting
that the nitrate was originally guano. Why should it not be true? For
this desert was once beside the sea, as it was once beneath the sea.</p>

<p>But the law of compensation works even here. It has always been common
opinion that the desert of Tarapacá shelters fabulous riches. Lured by
the glisten of a fallen meteor, men have squandered their fortunes and
risked their lives searching for gold, while they trod the nitrate under
foot.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>The large dark cave was gently steaming. The water filling it gurgled
out from sunless twilight, hot from the hold of the earth, cool as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57">{57}</a></span> it
spread over the desert valley from the mouth of the cave. A brown man
and his little daughter, lying in it, were being waved to and fro by the
water as it issued, just their heads visible. Saturating the bamboo
tangle, it left a wake of gardens, orange and guava trees, citrons,
figs, and slender <i>paltas</i>, tall <i>chirimoyas</i> and <i>pacays</i>, grown to
fruit-bearing size in six months. Trees of the jungle bathing in
incandescent desert light! There were thick mimosas, geranium trees, and
darts of poinsettia, grape-vines a foot across at the root, and spikes
of heavy-smelling tuberoses. Jasmine trailed on the trellis above my
head, and bougainvillea made a roof of purple flowers.</p>

<p>The slope of the sand-hills was crossed in the foreground by shadows of
orange groves, “indefinitely elongated.” Domestic constellations glowed
in their black foliage. Men in <i>ponchos</i> whirled up on mule-back,
unbuckled their three-inch spurs, and flapped their saddles down. This
time the mirage was real.</p>

<p>Old Dorothea came down from her bright green veranda, where the sunshine
glistened from a humming-bird’s wings as it hovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58" id="page_58">{58}</a></span> above a passion
flower, a whirl of black fringe with yellow deeps, the favored blossom
which the Incas carried in their hands as a sign of greatness. She held
a dove in the crotch of her arm and offered me a bunch of narcissus and
white fleurs-de-lis, unthinkably sweet. She was dressed in yellow ocher
and an old straw hat which she removed on being introduced to ladies.
Her little earless dancing dog did a <i>cueca</i> (native dance) for us,
while she clapped queer aboriginal time, and the gold hands danced in
her ears.</p>

<p>Birds sang in the thorn hedgerows, and frogs croaked in the warm pool,
frogs which die in cold water.</p>

<p>Dorothea said that some day the desert will again be covered with
forests and gardens, as it was before it became a desert.</p>

<p>In a cloud of dust made luminous by the sun, a drove of llamas galloped
down over the desert hillside to drink, soft eyes wonderingly looking
out from tall fuzzy heads, legs bungling with heavy wool. An old Indian
woman in Panama hat and brilliant blankets followed slowly, puffing at a
pipe.</p>

<p>This pool in a shadowed vale of the western Andes, a shady,
sweet-smelling spot, lost in an immensity of desert, is a little
solitude in the midst of a great solitude, hospitable by sweet contrast.
It takes very little water to make a perfect pool for a tiny fish, where
it will find its world and paradise all in one, with never an intimation
of the dry bank.</p>

<p>A large butterfly poised gently on the water’s surface. It was sunset
time, the butterflies’ drinking hour. A copper bell tolled slowly. The
reverberation pierced far into the silence and was “prolonged by the
whole surrounding desert.” A boy perched on an overhanging rock was
playing a flute. The frail sounds echoed through the quiet air,
“hesitating within a silence almost too large.” What can give such an
impression of space as a flute? Or, in ceasing, leave such utter
stillness? A gorgeous peacock preened itself against the crimson
bougainvillea in the sunset, then folded its fan for the night.</p>

<p>It is curious how the atmosphere of a dream cannot be conveyed in words.</p>

<p>Sitting beneath the mango tree by a lily-<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_60" id="page_60">{60}</a></span>edged brook, I watched the low
bonfire roasting desert quail and smelled the scent of heliotrope
hedges, while I listened to an old man’s plaintive song, mingling with a
quiet desert waterfall. A wild youth with a bullet gash across one cheek
told me of reckless escapades in the valleys above. He twisted off
oranges with a stick of bamboo and dropped them into my lap, as the
moon, poised on the crest of the mauve-colored Andes like a discus
thrown by a mighty arm from beyond, disengaged herself and traveled
upward. Moonlight, he said, is brighter in the mountain defiles. The
moon sometimes drops a rainbow up there, a faint, round, dream rainbow,
made of thin far-diluted sunlight. Pushed by a little breeze, it divides
the cloud and disappears.</p>

<p>He pointed out the false Cross preceding the true Cross, preparing its
way into the sky.</p>

<p>“Some violets have got in here,” he said suddenly, tweaking one out by
the roots. Intrusive violets!</p>

<p>A man with spurs passed <i>picante</i> and young kid and trays of fruit,
their crevices filled with flowers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61">{61}</a></span></p>

<p>Was not Amiel right when he said that “<i>Un paysage est un état d’âme</i>?”</p>

<p>It was an “ambrosial night,” in a place to attach affection, except that
affection is not for places, either actually or in retrospect. One
heart-beat faster, and the nitrate desert has fairy illusions. Why is it
that merely seeing foreign sights leaves only craving, while a whiff of
feeling in a distant, lonely spot fills one with the meaning and the
mystery of everything and brings tears to the eyes of memory? The purple
of the bare mountains is significant in the afterglow. Dripping water is
significant. The moon sheds a different light. The heat of the desert
sand just below the surface becomes suggestive. The air is filled with
indefinable odors never perceived elsewhere, and the sight of a
sand-colored bird explains all the secrets of the universe.</p>

<p>The beauty which alone would have woven a spell about the place merely
lapsed into a background. In itself the voice was not faultless, nor the
moon different from other windless, immaculate nights; but the air was
sweeter, and the guavas were at the season’s climax,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62">{62}</a></span> their one day of
perfection. They tell you that if you eat guavas in Pica, you become
either ill or enchanted; in either case you cannot leave.</p>

<p>He must have been talking for a long time. It was as if his voice had
been beneath my range of sound, or too soft&mdash;though I heard well enough.
All at once I began to understand.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you have heard of the bush which grows in Patagonia. It is
covered with pale yellow flowers. When a match is placed beneath it, the
bush blazes forth and is reduced to immediate ashes, all its strength
exhausted in a single dazzling effort. It is called <i>escandalosa</i>.</p>

<p>“Had you let me know two weeks ago that you would come, I would have put
a bit of nitrate on the roots of my rose-tree, and it would have
blossomed viciously for you!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “but afterwards?”</p>

<p>“Oh, to be sure. Then it would have died.”</p>

<p>An owl screamed from the top of a <i>ciruela</i> tree, a little
owl-of-the-desert, just a few inches high.</p>

<p>Pica, the Flower of the Sand! With what<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_63" id="page_63">{63}</a></span> golden words borrowed from
Hindoo poets might not its charm be told? By what enchantment its suave
breezes be recalled? Everybody knows it is a magic spot. Its quiet
existence is a sort of self-expression of inmost thoughts without
technique.</p>

A CLASH OF CONTRASTS</h3>

<h4>I</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the mysticism of the Middle Ages was expanding in delicate spires
of Gothic architecture, the Inca’s empire was exposing its heart of gold
to the blaze of a tropical sun. Their only similarity is that a shadowy
veil, half history, half legend, floats between us and them both. But
the gold shines through, and the veil cannot conceal its brilliancy.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a garden of pleasure where flowers of gold
opened from silver stalks, some full blown, others in close golden bud.
Upon the walls crept strange insects and snails, so perfectly
counterfeited in gold “that they wanted nothing but motion.” Even the
trees and the paths were of gold. Birds of gold perched upon golden
boughs, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65">{65}</a></span> heads thrown back in silent song, and upon silver leaves
gold butterflies poised in the sunlight upon their little golden feet.
Humming-birds of gold sipped imaginary honey from long, golden
flower-bells. The old chronicler, Cieza de Leon, says that one garden
“was artificially sown with golden maize, the stalks, as well as the
leaves and cobs being of that metal; ... they were so well planted that
even in a high wind they were not torn up; and besides all this they had
more than twenty golden sheep with their lambs, and the shepherds with
their slings and hooks to watch them, all made of the same metal.” Near
by were vast heaps of gold and silver, waiting to be wrought into
wonderful shapes.</p>

<p>The Inca ate within gold-lined walls, sitting “commonly on a stool of
massive gold set on a large, square plate of gold which served for a
pedestal.” He ate from gold dishes rare viands from distant provinces,
prepared in gold pots and kettles in a kitchen supplied with piles of
golden fagots! He bathed in cisterns of gold in water conducted through
golden pipes from distant springs. Francisco Lopez says: “Nay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_66" id="page_66">{66}</a></span> there
was nothing in all that empire (the most flourishing of the whole world)
whereof there was not a counterfeit in pure gold.”</p>

<p>As hunger could not be satisfied with gold, it was valued only for its
shining beauty, esteemed by the Incas’ subjects only as a symbol of the
Sun, those “tears which the Sun has wept.” They naturally belonged to
him. His worshippers even cast them into lakes, mirrors in which he
looks upon his own reflected glory, and “sinks at last still gazing on
it.”</p>

<p>The greatest of all Sun-Temples was Coricancha&mdash;the Ingot of Gold&mdash;where
every implement in use, even to spades and rakes of the garden, was made
of gold.</p>

<p>Huayna Ccapac had learned from the god Uiracocha that a superior people
would conquer the Incas and introduce a new religion. They would come
after the reign of twelve kings; and “In me,” he said, “the number of
twelve kings is completed.”</p>

<p>Oracles had predicted their coming. And what was more significant, the
great oracle of Rimac, “notwithstanding its former readiness of speech,
was become silent!” Omens had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67">{67}</a></span> foreshadowed them. A brilliant comet
“struck Atahualpa with such a dump of melancholy in his spirits that he
remained almost insensible.” A royal eagle pursued by hawks fell into
the market-place of Cuzco and died. Great earthquakes shattered the
shore, and tides did not keep their usual course. A thunderbolt fell in
the Inca’s own palace. Strange apparitions faltered in the air, terrible
to behold. The Moon, mother of Incas, had three halos; the first
blood-red, the second blackish, inclining to green, the third like mist
or smoke.</p>

<p>Atahualpa’s atrocities had come to pass. For the first time civil war
had decimated the empire of the Lover of the Poor, the Deliverer of the
Oppressed. Such conduct had earned its reward. Was it not to be expected
that the dawn-heroes of fair complexion, absent for a season, should
reappear? Their vengeance was commissioned by the Light-god.</p>

<p>What greater dramatic climax ever focused? What authority was ever more
solidly founded? What identity of hero-gods more tangibly proven? A
first appearance which further facts continued to corroborate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_68" id="page_68">{68}</a></span></p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lured</span> by rumors of a descendant of the Sun in a city of gold, the first
lean, poor adventurer, worn with uncertainty and suffering, stepped upon
the shore of Peru. Pedro de Candia was his name, who, having burned ten
cities, had dedicated in expiation ten lamps to the Virgin. His “coat of
mail reached to his knees, his helmet of the best and bravest sort, his
sword girt by his side. He took a target of steel in his left hand, and
in his right a wooden cross a yard and a half long,” advancing toward
the Indians. Two fierce jaguars, “beholding the cross,” fawned upon him
and cast themselves at his feet. Taking courage at the sight, he laid it
upon their backs and dared to stroke their heads. By virtue of that
symbol a miracle had happened. Pedro de Candia and the Indians were
equally dumbfounded.</p>

<p>They followed him to the temples and palaces furnished and plated with
gold and silver, all awed to silence, he at such magnificence in an
undiscovered country, they at the sight of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69">{69}</a></span> tall, fair man, whose
long beard hung down over his iron dress; all were convinced by this
first encounter, the Indians of the divinity of the Spaniards, the
Spaniards of God’s patronage. “Being abundantly satisfied with what he
had seen, he returned with all joy imaginable to his companions, taking
much larger steps back than his gravity allowed him in his march toward
the people.”</p>

<p>Eye-witnesses have described the Spaniards’ first glimpse of Atahualpa,
the red fringe shining on his forehead, when Hernando de Soto, the most
daring of all Pizarro’s followers, caracoled upon his miraculous beast
into the very lap of the dignified monarch. They feasted and drank
<i>chicha</i> from goblets of gold which young girls presented to them,
sitting upon seats of gold like the emperor’s own. Two historians were
present “who with their <i>quipus</i> (knots) made certain ciphers describing
... all the passages of that audience.”</p>

<p>In Cajamarca, the Country of Frost, Atahualpa returned the visit. He
came in full regalia, facing the pomp of a gorgeous sunset, and the
Spaniards, “brandishing their pen<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70">{70}</a></span>nants toward the flaring west, saluted
with a great shout the Setting of the Sun!”</p>

<p>First came multitudes of people clearing the way of stones and sweeping
the road, then singers and dancers in three divisions, many richly
dressed courtiers, and the guards, divided into four squadrons of eight
thousand men, one before, one on each side of the Inca, and one in the
rear. High on the shoulders of distinguished chiefs he rode upon a
golden litter lined with brilliant feathers. His proud head, too large
for his body, was encircled by the red fringe hanging above his wild and
bloodshot eyes. Atahualpa, that courageous fiend who bragged that no
bird flew in the air, no leaf fluttered on a tree without his
permission, who though ransomed with a roomful of gold was taken
prisoner in the midst of his own army by a handful of insolent
adventurers, baptized in the Christian faith “Don Juan,” bound to a
post, and throttled like a common criminal! Pizarro put himself into
mourning.</p>

<p>The legend which had lured the Spaniards was proven true: that the land
of a powerful king lay toward the south, where immeasurable<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_71" id="page_71">{71}</a></span> treasure
was amassed. It took a month to melt up the gold plaques and plates,
brackets and moldings, statues of men, animals and plants, drinking and
eating utensils, jars and jewelry of all sorts that filled Atahualpa’s
room of ransom.</p>

<p>A huge quantity of gold, carried by eleven thousand llamas and intended
for the ransom, never arrived. It is said to lie buried near Jauja, and
is only one of the countless masses of hidden treasure, both along the
coast and in the mountains, even into Ecuador. The Spanish messengers
who were carried in hammocks to inspect that caravan on its journey
toward Cajamarca were almost blinded by a mountain seeming to shine from
base to crest with gold. The eleven thousand llamas had laid themselves
down to rest.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> they had come at last, the very image of the god himself, strange
little Uiracochas in beards and ruffs; worthy of worship indeed, for
they let loose thunder and lightning, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">{72}</a></span> proper arms of the Sun, from
instruments held in their hands, and rode about on amazing beasts. (The
Indians’ fear of horses persisting to this day, they are used only as
infantry.) Were the Uiracochas insensible of hunger and thirst; did they
need sleep after toil and repose after labor? Were they made of flesh
and bones, or had they incorruptible bodies like those of the Sun and
the Moon?</p>

<p>So the grisly conquerors came, half heroes, half wild beasts, who did
not grow exhausted by fighting, nor discouraged by wounds and the
horrors of mountain-sickness.</p>

<p>So they came, these few poor adventurers who fell upon a roomful of gold
given them by a people in ransom for the sovereign-deity whom this
handful of men had imprisoned. Miracles in their favor seemed to spring
up at each step; and madly stimulated, the peaks of the cordillera
blazing above them, their imaginations limitless, they strode through
the empire in the guise of gods and scraped the sacred gold from the
City of the Sun. They ripped the plate from the walls of its temples.
They destroyed the idols. It is said that the Jesuits</p>

<p class="nind">had to employ thirty persons for three days to break up a single carved
stone <i>huaco</i> (idol). They dug up the treasures buried with the dead and
pillaged the towns, and they brought back to greedy European sovereigns
news of a land of gold. Having, as it seemed to them, found infinitely,
they hoped infinitely and infinitely dared.</p>

<p>The glittering career of the Indies had begun. No empire was ever won in
so grandiose a way; no empire ever so monstrously destroyed.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Picturesque</span> are the figures of the two great conquerors, Francisco
Pizarro and Diego de Almagro, lean and tireless soldiers, “either of
whom, single, could break through a body of a hundred Indians,” who
amassed a fortune, the greatest that had been known in many ages, wasted
it in wars with each other, and died so poor that they were “buried of
mere charity.”</p>

<p>They dressed in the costume of their youth. The marquis “never wore
other than a jerkin of black cloth with skirts down to his ankles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_74" id="page_74">{74}</a></span> with
a short waist a little below his breast. His shoes were made of a white
cordivant, his hat white, with sword and dagger after the old fashion.
Sometimes upon high days, at the instance and request of his servants,
he wore a cassock lined with martins’ furs which had been sent him from
Spain,” but his coat of mail was underneath, as appropriate to his body
as its steely sheath to his heart. Illiterate, greedy, fearless, and
proud, wading through blood to establish the Christian faith, he was
murdered at last; and as he fell, traced in his own blood a cross upon
the stone floor, kissed it, and died.</p>

<p>Then there was the able monster, Carvajal, who went about accompanied by
three or four negroes to strangle people. He jeered as they did so,
“showing himself very pleasant and facetious at that unseasonable time.”
He left behind him a wake of spiked heads of “traitors” to the king. He
wore a Moorish burnous and hens’ feathers twined together in the form of
a cross on his hat, bought masses with emeralds for his soul’s repose,
and at the age of eighty-four went to his execution in a basket, saying
his prayers in Latin. “Being come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_75" id="page_75">{75}</a></span> the place of execution, the people
crowded so to see him that the hangman had not room to do his duty. And
thereupon he called to them and said: ‘Gentlemen, pray give the officer
room to do justice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_76" id="page_76">{76}</a></span>’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VIa" id="CHAPTER_VIa"></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><br />
PIRATES AND TREASURE FLEETS</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Gold</span>,” said Columbus, “constitutes treasure, and he who possesses it
has all he needs in this world, as also the means of rescuing souls from
purgatory and restoring them to the enjoyment of paradise.” Raleigh
remarked that: “Where there is store of gold, it is needless to remember
other commodities for trade.”</p>

<p>Gold&mdash;the evil spell overshadowing Peru, pouring out her immeasurable
riches to impoverish Spain. Gold&mdash;the most incorruptible of all metals,
itself the cause of most corruption!</p>

<p>Peru has always been cursed by wealth. The gold of the Incas was the
cause of their destruction, the wealth of the Spanish conquerors,
theirs; it brought about wars among themselves and ravages of foreign
pirates upon the sea. When the era of precious metals seemed to wane,
islands of guano were discov<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_77" id="page_77">{77}</a></span>ered, apparently an endless source of
wealth. But it was greedily exhausted by foreigners. Then came the
discovery of nitrate fields, where fortunes are merely scraped off the
top of the ground. But that particular territory has been annexed by a
prosperous neighbor.</p>

<p>One wonders what undiscovered wealth may still be threatening this
lavish country.</p>

<p>The days when fleets of treasure sailed from the distant cordilleras of
the Spanish Main had begun. The tall, enchanted galleons of Lima spread
sail, with their</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>At first the argosies bore off the ransom of Atahualpa, the golden
ornaments belonging to the Sun.</p>

<p>Albrecht Dürer, in his Tagebuch, wrote of having seen a boatload of such
booty from the Indies. “And, moreover, have I seen the things which were
brought from the new golden land to the king&mdash;an entire sun of gold, a
full<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_78" id="page_78">{78}</a></span> fathom wide, likewise a silver moon of the same size, also two
rooms full of armor, all manner of weapons, harness, war-trappings, and
strange accoutrements, curious raiment, bed-draperies and many kinds of
wondrous things for divers uses, fairer to behold than marvels. They are
all so precious that they are held to be worth a hundred thousand
gulden.</p>

<p>“Nor have I in all the days of my life seen aught that did so fill me
with delight. For I saw there fine-wrought things of cunning design, and
marveled at the subtle skill of men in far countries. Nor know I how to
tell of all the things which I saw there.”</p>

<p>Loot of golden treasure gave way to mountains of silver, which poured
forth their wealth in such profusion that it staggers even oriental
imagination. Loading at Arica, ships brought silver direct from the
mines of Potosí. Then there was plunder of Peruvian churches, jeweled
chalices, and gold shrines. There were emeralds from the north&mdash;a land
where they were sacred, small emeralds being sacrificed to larger ones.</p>

<p>These glittering cargoes were carried home to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_79" id="page_79">{79}</a></span> Seville, the “Queen of
the Ocean.” Its wonderful Casa de Contratación dealt with the wealth of
the Indies and, to quote Alonzo Morgado, “the riches which flowed into
its offices would have been sufficient to pave the streets of Seville
with gold and silver slabs.”</p>

<p>Like most stories of Peru, the gold and silver it exported seem mere
extravaganza. Contemporary accounts, mostly in cipher, may be quoted.</p>

<p>In 1538, G. Loveday wrote to Lord Lisle: “Spanish ships have returned
from Peru so laden that the emperor’s part amounts to two million
ducats.... The emperor has borrowed the whole from the owners.” Being
“occasionally pinched for money,” he found it most convenient to seize
the ships laden with private treasure from his “Indyac of Perrow.”</p>

<p>In July, 1555, the Venetian ambassador in England wrote to the Doge and
Senate of a fleet of caravels, “all very richly freighted according to
the usual parlance of these Spaniards, who invariably reckon by
millions.”</p>

<p>Federico Badoer Venetian ambassador with the emperor, wrote (1556) that
the king would<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80">{80}</a></span> obtain so considerable a sum of money that he would be
able to defend himself not only against the Pope but also against France
and any other power, if necessary. By this time Peru was raining gold
and silver.</p>

<p>Father Acosta returned to Spain with the fleet of 1587. In his boat were
twelve chests of gold, each weighing a hundred pounds; eleven million
pieces of silver, and two chests of emeralds, each weighing one hundred
pounds. “The reason why there is so great an abundance of metals at the
Indies,” he wrote, “is the will of the Creator, who hath imparted His
gifts as it pleased Him.”</p>

<p>Von Tschudi says that in the first twenty-five years the Spaniards got
four hundred millions of ducats of gold and silver, which was, however,
only a small part of the vast amount buried or thrown into the mountain
lakes whose deep waters concealed it in underground caves. “The Indians,
taking a handful of grain from a whole measure, said: ‘Thus much the
Christians have gained and the remainder is lodged where neither we nor
any one else is able to assign.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81" id="page_81">{81}</a></span>’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>Humboldt says that from the discovery of Peru until 1800, the Old World
received £516,471,344 worth of treasure from the New World. No wonder
Europe felt that gold lay about in this land of gold, and that it was
only necessary to go and pick it up. No wonder Europe still has an idea
of America little changed through four hundred years. And yet only one
fifth of the treasure of mines and grave-mounds was supposed to be sent
to Spain, whose galleons came to the far-away West Indies to receive it.</p>

<p>It was not long before pirates descended upon Peru. Brittany was the
first to fit out fleets for the Indies “on pretense of carrying
merchandise thither,” in fact, to molest vessels coming from Peru.</p>

<p>Next, English buccaneers intercepted the Spanish vessels, slow-sailing
under weight of gold.</p>

<p>Sir Francis Drake, with sixty armed ships, looted the Pacific in the
<i>Golden Hynde</i>. His ballast was silver, his cargo gold and emeralds. He
dined alone with music.</p>

<p>In 1578 he took from the Spanish galleon <i>Cacafuego</i> “twenty tons of
silver bullion, thirteen chests of silver coins, a hundred-weight of
gold, gold nuggets in indefinite quantity, a great store of pearls,
emeralds, and diamonds, ... and many, many other things.” Only Queen
Elizabeth and Drake knew the exact amount that was taken.</p>

<p>For three centuries pirates and freebooters harried the treasure-fleets
of Spain. Toward the end of the seventeenth century, the English
Calendar of State Papers compassionately remarks that foreign gluttony
“keeps the poor Spaniards in arms all along the coast of Peru and puts
them into strange apprehension, all mankind seeming to conspire the
murdering and destroying them as common enemies, not because they do
worse, but have more than ordinary.”</p>

<p>Much of the twice-looted treasure never reached Europe, for, following

<h4>I</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> lay Lima under a tropical sun, sparkling with treasure, a
wilderness of rich carvings and paintings, whose piles of gold and
silver shone through the thick perfume of exotic blossoms. Long
caravans, loaded with the wealth of the provinces as well as the produce
of sales in the remote interior, filed into Lima, where countless
gold-and silver-smiths were awaiting their arrival. Weavers of silks,
velvets, and brocades, embroiderers, leather and metal workers,
sculptors, artists, makers of glass and porcelain bells&mdash;all the most
skilled workmen flocked to the capital of New Andalusia, the continent’s
center, for there they found no lack of rich materials. Their fancy
might fashion uncontrolled, with assurance of eager purchasers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85">{85}</a></span></p>

<p>In Lima voyages of discovery to the Isles of Solomon were planned. From
Lima pilgrimages were made in search of El Dorado, that luxurious ruler
who bathed himself in sweet-smelling gums and then rolled in gold dust.
There is no more romantic chapter in the history of Peru than these
pilgrimages in search of El Dorado. Southey says they cost Spain more
than all the treasure received from her South American possessions.</p>

<p>In Lima lived the viceroys who ruled all of South America from Guayaquil
to Buenos Aires, “as by the divine right of kings.” The viceroy was
served only by titled Spaniards. He was drawn about by six horses, with
sounding of trumpets, and a personal guard of two hundred Spaniards,
“for the safety of his person and to support the dignity of his office.”
The royal seal, his insignia, rode under a royal flag upon a horse
saddled with black velvet and a gold tissue foot-cloth, and was received
with deep bows. The viceroy was allowed three thousand <i>pesos</i> to go to
Callao, five miles away, and sixty thousand ducats a year for personal
expenses.</p>

<p>Greeted with a jewel sent to meet him half-<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86">{86}</a></span>way, the viceroy reaches the
bay of Callao. Throughout Lima, the City of the Kings,&mdash;founded “with
God, for God, and in His name,"&mdash;the streets are hung with rugs and
tapestry and adorned with green boughs and triumphal arches. (On the
arrival of the Duque de la Plata, in 1682, eighty million <i>piasters</i>
were spent to pave the streets with bars of silver.)</p>

<p>“First comes a host of Indian warriors in feather pomp. The city militia
with pikes and weapons glittering, the stocks of their guns embossed
with gold, the noble guard on horseback, ... university professors in
brilliant gowns, the royal council and officials, the magistracy in
crimson velvet lined with brocade of the same color ... the chamber of
accounts, the audience on horses with trappings, the scepter-carrier,
heralds in armor with uncovered heads, the master of the horse with
drawn sword, accompanied by four servants in livery, pages with the
captain of the watch, and lastly, on a throne of red velvet whose silver
staffs are carried by the members of the corporation, while the
<i>alcaldes</i> hold the cords, all in velvet caps and gowns of incarnation
color, rides<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87">{87}</a></span> the viceroy under the royal banner and a canopy of cloth
of gold. Officers of the royal household, the royal guard in full armor
with spear and shield, bring up the rear on horseback.”</p>

<p>The procession moves between companies of halberdiers in a blaze of
trumpets, bells, and drums, under showers of flowers thrown from carved
balconies.</p>

<p>“When they reach the plaza the whole company faces the cathedral and is
received by the archbishop and by the superiors of the religious orders;
trumpets cease, knights dismount, and the multitude sings a Te Deum.</p>

<p>“The procession again mounts and accompanies the viceroy to the palace
gates.”</p>

<p>“Five days of bull-fights follow, and prizes are bestowed upon those who
make the most ingenious compositions in praise of the viceroy. The
rector of the university prepares a poetical contest, at which the
viceroy presides, seated upon the rectoral chair, which for this
occasion glitters with the magnificence of an Eastern throne. The
nunneries entertain him with music and present him with curiosities.”</p>

<p>The churches of Lima were hung with velvet<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span> and tapestry, with fringes
of gold and silver and plates of gold hung in design, so that the walls
were nowhere to be seen. Spanish and Flemish paintings surrounded altars
of wrought silver. The sacred vessels were of gold, covered with pearls
and precious stones. Santo Domingo, the oldest of the brotherhood,
possessed a set of thirty candelabra of massive silver, man-high, placed
in a double row along the nave of the church. The cloister contained a
famous orange garden with wrought-iron waterways and life-sized
paintings of Dominicus. In its center was a fountain, whose delicious
drip belied its hidden presence under feathery vines. Indeed, why should
the church not claim vast riches? One sixth of the population was in the
monasteries, and those who were not of the number bought the dress of a
religious order in which to be buried. The whole city took part in the
sacred feast days, as many in the procession as looking on: legions of
monks and thousands of nuns, priests, orders, religious societies, and
brotherhoods with their standards, holy pictures, silver crosses,
scepters, and biers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89" id="page_89">{89}</a></span></p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> what was happening to the silent people among the mountain-tops who
had stripped the Sun Temples of their offerings to enrich the
adventurers from the Isles of Pearls?</p>

<p>Their irrigating canals had been destroyed, the roads and the whole
system of government broken up, the people killed in chronic fighting or
by hardship in distant campaigns. Ten thousand of the fifteen thousand
in Almagro’s Chilean army had died of cold in the mountains, or of heat
and thirst in the desert. The people were starved, villages at a time,
by the destruction of their crops. Moreover, the villages were given as
fiefs to the Spaniards, who received all the tribute. Many were
exhausted by dragging heavy artillery over the precipitous mountains.
Garcilasso describes the immense beams that crushed the Indians
staggering beneath their weight, who were relieved, only on account of
necessity, at every two hundred paces. When Gonzalo Pizarro in coat of
mail covered with cloth of gold made his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90">{90}</a></span> triumphal entry as governor
into the City of the Kings, the twenty-two pieces of cannon which
saluted as the procession advanced through the streets, were carried on
the shoulders of six thousand Indians. All these Indians were well
trained in morality and sound doctrine by the clergy of Spain.</p>

<p>And worst of all, deep within the mountains of Peru, hollowed by the
gold and silver which they had removed to enrich a country of whose
existence they would never be aware in any other way, the Indians were
dying, thousands at a time. Skeletons concealed in old mines are now
found, covered with fibers of silver melted by subterranean fires just
beneath the cold desert. Mines now abandoned can be traced by piles of
human bones.</p>

<p>A pair of bright green arms, petitioning, stretched forth from the body
which has disappeared, were discovered in the bottom of an ancient
copper mine. The copper water had filtered through and covered them with
a green sheen. Every finger is tense with supplication, every fiber as
in the moment of death; not an eager tendon or nerve quivering to the
surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">{91}</a></span> failed of preservation. All are petrified in a bronze of
nature’s molding.</p>

<p>Stories are still told that the Spaniards drove ten thousand Indians at
once to work in a Peruvian mine. When their strength was exhausted or
they died from lack of food, the Spaniards drove up ten thousand
more&mdash;an extravaganza of destruction matched only by the scale of
nature’s waste. It must be said, however, that cruelty to the Indians
was due not to Spanish law, but to the abuse of it.</p>

<p>“In twenty-five years more than eight million Indians were worked to
death in the mines of Peru.”</p>

<p>“In a century, nine tenths of the people had been destroyed by overwork
and cruelty.”</p>

<p>No wonder Spain was able to equip an Armada!</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Against</span> such a dark background flamed the lurid Inquisition.</p>

<p>The working out of the <i>encomienda</i>, or system of slavery, and the
<i>mita</i>, or forced work in the mines, was more horrible than the
tortures<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_92" id="page_92">{92}</a></span> going on in Lima only because of the scale on which the
destruction took place. In 1570 the Blessing of the Inquisition had been
conferred upon Peru by Philip II. “At first heresy, then blasphemy,
sorcery, polygamy, insulting servants, opposition to jurisdiction, were
punished by whipping, banishment, prison, and death by fire. In all
cases the goods were confiscated.” The disgrace of an executed man did
not end even with his death. “The sons and daughters and grandchildren
of the male line lost their rights of citizenship. They might not carry
gold, silver, pearls, costly stones, corals, silk, velvet, or fine
cloth. They might not ride on horses, carry weapons, or use any of the
things of which they were unworthy.”</p>

<p>One star-spangled night, a man looking at the sky remarked that the
multitude of stars was superfluous, thus assuming that God had erred in
creation, which was heretical blasphemy. Juan de Arianza appeared in the
auto of 1631 because, when reading the Scriptures, he exclaimed: “Ea!
There is nothing but living and dying!” which sounded ill to those who
heard it. One man bragged that he had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93">{93}</a></span> horse that could go sixty
leagues in one day: for that he had two hundred strokes of the lash.
Another had said he knew an herb which made wives invisible before their
husbands: he received five years’ imprisonment. A young priest said he
had seen the little Saviour in his dreams: his punishment was two
hundred lashes and five years’ work in the galleys. Another, who wished
to found a new sect, had called the Indians the children of Israel and
had declared that priests should marry, that there should be no
confessional, and that the Bishop of Lima ought to be Pope. He thought
the Bible ought to be translated into the language of the people and
that he was holy as Gabriel and patient as Job. This unfortunate was
burned alive; the proceedings of the suit against him filled three
thousand pages.</p>

<p>Throughout the seventeenth century Peru was filled with mystic
impostors, like the far-famed Angela Carranza, most of whom were dealt
with by <i>autos de fe</i>. The use of coca was considered a part of this
sorcery and was punished severely.</p>

<p>The confession of a real or an accused crime<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94">{94}</a></span> was drawn out by torture
and compelled by a repetition of the torture. From the final judgment
there was no appeal. All was enacted under seal of deepest secrecy. The
torture chamber was somewhat removed, so that the screams of the victims
could not be heard in the street.</p>

<p>Three kinds of torture were used in Lima. There was the compound pulley.
A man’s hands were bound to his back, and he was raised by a pulley to
the ceiling by his hands; heavy iron weights were attached to his feet.
Sometimes, instead of this, the victim was strapped on a table, an iron
collar about his neck, and stretched in both directions without risk of
choking; but every bone in his body was dislocated. The second method
was smothering. The man’s hands and feet were tied above a bench, and on
his upper arms, thighs, and calves, lacing machines were adjusted. Then
a funnel was put in his mouth and water was slowly poured in. The third
method was the worst of all. The feet were made fast, the soles were
covered with fat, then live coals were brought gradually nearer and
nearer&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95">{95}</a></span> process of roasting. When the pain was keenest, a board was
shoved between coals and feet, and the sinner was asked if he would now
confess his crime.</p>

<p>By a bull of Paul III torture could not last over an hour. After that
the victim usually had convulsions or lost his mind. A doctor came,
whenever such was the case, to authorize further torture.</p>

<p>Thumbscrews were still used in 1813.</p>

<p>Dr. Lea says punishments in Lima were inflicted with greater rigor than
in Spain. If it were lashing, the penitents, without distinction as to
sex, were marched in procession through the streets, naked from the
waist up, with inscriptions denoting their offenses, while the
executioner plied the lash. The mob stoned them as an act of especial
piety.</p>

<p>The Inquisition had command of the press. The tribunal of Inquisitors,
judging all, were judged by none and wielded absolute power. The Holy
Tribunal did not wish to shed blood, so the accused were either
strangled or burned. The death-warrant began with the words <i>Christi
nomine invocato</i>, and officials of the law were<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96">{96}</a></span> asked to treat the
condemned with pity and moderation.</p>

<p>The <i>auto de fe</i>, the Act of Faith, was intended as a demonstration of
authority, a representation of the day of judgment, and it was the
highest exhibition of piety.</p>

<p>Following is a description of an <i>auto de fe</i> in Lima, on the sixteenth
of November, 1625, quoted from Middendorf.</p>

<p>A procession went at daybreak on horseback through the city, with
trumpets, fifes, and drums, to announce the execution. A platform was
built on the plaza, forty ells high, and a stadium was erected for eight
thousand people. “Between eight and nine in the morning the sinners were
called for. A cross covered with black crape belonging to the cathedral
was carried before them by four priests, all singing <i>miserere</i> in a
wailing tone. Each penitent walked between two soldiers and other
honorable persons. Silver boxes at the rear contained the judgments.</p>

<p>“The viceroy came out of his palace accompanied by a guard of honor,
musketeers, and two trumpeters. Doctors, lawyers, and uni<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97">{97}</a></span>versity
professors preceded the monks and the priests, standard bearers in coats
of mail with clubs, the captain of the watch, and judges, the oldest of
whom walked by the viceroy, cavalry, generals, and pages. The
Inquisitors had hats on top of their caps, worn only at that time,
decorated with the insignia of the Pope’s legates. The militia had
formed in line, and at the appearance of the black and gold banner of
the Inquisition they lowered their flags in salute. An altar was raised,
a chair for the viceroy and the high officials.</p>

<p>“The eldest one rose and addressed the viceroy. ‘Your Excellency swears
and promises upon his faith and word as a true Catholic Viceroy
appointed by His Catholic Highness, to defend with all his might the
Catholic faith, which the Holy Apostolic Church in Rome recognizes, to
further its well being and growth, to follow up the heretics and
dissenters and enemies, to give necessary help and aid to the Holy
Tribunal of the Inquisition and its servants, so that the heretics and
disturbers of our Christian religion shall be taken and punished
according to the law of the Holy Church, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_98" id="page_98">{98}</a></span>out your Excellency making
any exception in favor of anybody no matter what his station in life
be.’</p>

<p>“The viceroy replied: ‘I swear it and promise by my faith and word.’</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>If your Excellency does so, as we expect from your piety and
Christianity you will, the Lord God will bless all the works undertaken
by your Excellency in His holy service and will give you health and long
life as this kingdom and the service of His Majesty needs.’</p>

<p>“A mass was read for the viceroy, and a priest extolled from the chancel
the glory which comes to religion through the sacrifice of heretics.
After the sermon, all pledged themselves to tell any act contrary to
religion which they knew of, and not to give protection to any heretic
who was under the ban of the church.</p>

<p>“The denunciation was read as soon as the culprit was named, led up out
of his secret cell and put into a cage from which he had to hear his
final judgment. He was dressed in the San Benito, in itself a lasting
shame. It reached to the knees of the sinner and had his portrait
painted upon it surrounded by flames, devils,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99">{99}</a></span> and dragons. On his head
he wore a bag-like, high and pointed cap, on which were devils’ faces in
flames. Gags were ready in case blasphemers should break out against the
judges.”</p>

<p>The burning is said to have taken place where the bull-ring now is.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1746 the city of Lima,&mdash;the gorgeous City of the Kings,&mdash;at the
climax of its luxury, was utterly destroyed. Seventy-four churches,
fourteen monasteries with their paintings, lamps of gold, vessels of
silver, precious stones, tapestries, and mirrors, their beautiful
fountains, arches, cloisters, and stairways in rare designs, were laid
waste. The building material was as rich as the work upon it; as a
contemporary traveler expressed it: “If it did not exceed in beauty, it
at least equaled anything in the world.” In four minutes there was
complete desolation. Out of the whole city only twenty buildings
remained standing. Bridges broke, palaces fell, the sick in the
hospitals were buried alive; nuns in their cloisters, monks in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100">{100}</a></span>
cells, were suffocated in clouds of sulphurous dust. Churches collapsed,
crushing those who were praying within. Even the Holy Inquisition was
obliged to suspend torture for the time being.</p>

<p>The earth was like an animal shaking the dust from its back. It swept
forward in great waves; walls were reeds on its shores, bending to the
tempest. Between the waves, clouds of poisonous dust rose from the
chasms.</p>

<p>Clocks stopped. Bells in the towers clashed with limp bell ropes, till
towers following in turn stifled the din under smoking débris.
Everything was reversed; that which stood still was set in violent
motion, and moving things were brought to rest. Shrieks for help and
agonized prayers mingled, until they, too, ceased.</p>

<p>The sea retreated half a league from Callao, gathered strength from
unknown, hidden places, and with a cosmic roar rushed over the entire
city, engulfing it and carrying all the ships of the harbor across its
walls and towers to be stranded in inland gardens. All of its five
thousand inhabitants perished in the deluge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101">{101}</a></span> and there was nothing left
to give the least idea of what Callao had been.</p>

<p>“To be preserved from its fury could only be attributed to a particular
and extraordinary help of Providence.” Yet thousands in Lima who had
escaped destruction or death from fright died of fevers which came
after. Those who remained were occupied with burying the dead in
trenches. Famine as well as fever followed, for the grain magazines of
Callao had been buried under water, ovens had fallen in, aqueducts
bringing water for turning the mills had been destroyed.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. Loath to give up its fiendish hold, not yet glutted
with destruction, the underground fury visited the helpless ruins it had
created with five hundred and sixty-eight earthquakes during the next
year!</p>

<p>Processions of priests barefoot, with crowns of thorns on their heads,
cords about their necks, and heavy chains on their ankles, taught the
people that the destruction was of God, the roaring of the subterranean
powers a warning against luxury. The prior of one society went about
covered with ashes; a heavy bridle<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102">{102}</a></span> cut his mouth, iron nails fastened
his eyelids, his back was bare. “This is the punishment that God in
heaven executes,” said a lay brother, walking behind him, as he let fall
an iron lash so heavily that the blood spurted.</p>

<p>The bones of Santo Toribio and Santa Rosa were carried about; the
viceroy and great persons followed in mourning, with ropes about their
necks. Distinguished ladies, barefoot, their hair shaved, walked in
coarse clothes. The dense stillness was broken by a monk’s voice: “Holy
God, Holy God, be merciful to us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103" id="page_103">{103}</a></span>”</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VIIIa" id="CHAPTER_VIIIa"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><br />
LIMA OF TWO ASPECTS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> valley of the Rimac, where glisten the towers of Lima, is only one
of the river-ways which cross the desert. The river of the ancient
oracle Rimac, “he who speaks,” has given its name in perverted form to
Lima&mdash;the Spanish city. The temple of the speaker was in ruins long
before Spanish days.</p>

<p>Like other streams of the west coast, the great river Rimac has run
through the gamut of all zones. Hurrying down from the cordillera, it
spreads fertility far and wide over the dry shore-valley. As far away as
Chorillos, “little water jets,” the water of the Rimac filters through,
led astray for irrigation. But its own journey to the sea is vain. The
mountain water is so precious to the desert that by the time the stream
has reached the shore, it has not force enough left to make an outlet
across the beach into the ocean.</p>

<p>Irrigating ditches and crumbling mud walls<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104">{104}</a></span> divide gardens and vineyards
and orchards of wind-blown olive trees. Ruins of mud accumulate dust.
Luxuriant nasturtiums drape every dusty bank. Vestiges of fortresses,
temples, and grave-mounds of the three ancient cities of the Rimac
valley still terrify owners of the sugar-fields, for the inhabitants of
the sepulchers sometimes return at night to sit beneath the grape-arbors
and listen to the murmur of irrigation streams which they made.
Cajamarquilla, Armatambo, and Huadca were the names of these cities, and
the whirlwind was their most distinguished god. His white-robed priests
ate neither salt nor pepper, and tore out the hearts of men and of
animals to offer them to the gods on the platforms of temples.</p>

<p>Sometimes, too, the Huguenot hermit who lived near the site of Huadca
and who was burned by the Inquisition returns to his little caves at
nightfall.</p>

<p>Lima is in the tropics. Its fruits and flowers are those of the tropics.
Yet it is neither hot nor cold. There is no rain and not too much sun, a
pleasant monotony interrupted only by earthquakes. An umbrella merchant
once tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105">{105}</a></span> to set up business in Lima. His act brought forth an article
in a local paper on rain, and how on one occasion when it came suddenly
people had to get out of bed to find secure places. Editorials on
umbrellas followed.</p>

<p>No, there is little to fear from changes of weather, not even thunder
and lightning. There is an endless summer, with streets under a
continuous awning; yet, after all, only a summer. The rainless desert is
soaked in mist all winter long. It falls suddenly like a veil over the
bare mountains and drenches the sunlight. A glimpse through it shows a
faint sheen, sharp cliffs hazy with hues of light-green velvet, enameled
on closer inspection with multitudes of differing flowers. <i>Amancaes</i>
spring up dew-laden, those queer, greenish-yellow lilies hanging on
smooth, leafless stems, giving their name to whole valleys which they
fill. One such lies beyond the gardens of the Barefoot Friars. A
favorite retreat for Limaneans, it is called the National Garden. But
scorpions lie under the stones.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>“A suggestive kind of picture used to hang in many a mediaeval church.
It was painted<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106">{106}</a></span> on both sides of a board. On one side were a pair of
lovers walking hand in hand in a meadow gay with spring. Flowers
blossomed about their feet; birds sang in the trees above their heads.</p>

<p>“On the reverse was the grim figure of Death, hour-glass and scythe in
hand. The thing, pendent from a single cord, hung free in a draughty
place, and the air twisted it about hither and thither, so that one side
and the other was seen in swift interchange.”</p>

<p>The Alameda, flanked with Norfolk Island pines and marble benches, had
in other days rows upon rows of orange trees, stone fountains, and
basins as well. At five in the afternoon gilded carriages streamed from
palace gardens, driving about so that their fair occupants could greet
their friends. Four thousand brocade-lined, gold-trimmed carriages and
innumerable chaises shimmered through the heavy odor of orange blossoms.</p>

<p>A traveler of the seventeenth century has described the lady of Lima,
clad not in linen, but in the most expensive lace of Flanders, slipped
over an underdress of cloth of gold.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="ill_008" style="width: 428px;">

<div class="caption"><p>GRAPES RAISED BY THE BAREFOOT FRIARS, (<i>LOS DESCALZOS</i>),
LIMA.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107">{107}</a></span></p>

<p>She glittered with jewels from head to foot, her shoes were fastened
with diamond buckles, aigrettes of diamonds were in her hair&mdash;“a
splendor still the more astonishing as it is so very common,” he said.
Nay, she even scattered perfume through her nosegays. On great fête days
she tiptoed to church, enveloped all but one eye in a silk-lace shawl.
Beneath it glinted a flower-embroidered dress of rarest stuff,
fluttering a multitude of ribbons; under a petticoat of heavy brocade,
miniature golden feet peeped out, or slippers of peach-colored velvet.
The lady of Lima was famed for her wit, entrancing the visitor as she
sipped her Paraguay tea from a silver-mounted gourd.</p>

<p>Little is left of former splendor. The statues, the five rows of orange
trees, the sweet smells are gone. At the end of the long Alameda,
bordered with wind-blown trees and wrecks of marble benches, is a
fountain under palms and Norfolk Island pines. Across a shady space and
above a high, yellow plaster wall, is the monastery tower, where hangs a
clear-toned bell. Rugged hills rise abruptly. This is the home of the
Barefoot Friars. A labyrinth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">{108}</a></span> paths leads to their orchards and
gardens and cells. Going every morning in pairs to the markets to beg
for food, they own nothing. They live entirely on alms.</p>

<p>Just before two o’clock each day, the lame, halt, and blind begin to
gather from all the town wards, each carrying a receptacle. One poor
woman with three or four babies seats herself upon the plaster shelf
skirting the wall, setting down her pottery jar by the brook to wait.</p>

<p>The bell strikes two long, clear tones. The whole space is filled. The
great monastery gate is flung open, and two brown-clad monks, sleeves
rolled up, bring out between them a steaming copper cauldron. The
famished multitude fall to their knees, many with difficulty, and a
prayer is intoned.</p>

<p>Then the procession begins: men, women, and children in various stages
of decrepitude. Beggars with old tin cans totter forward as to the Mecca
of a long, hard journey. Decent-looking women, very haughty, conceal
their pails under black <i>mantas</i>. Each receives two ladlefuls of meat,
soup, and vegetables. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109">{109}</a></span> kettle is filled again and refilled, till all
are served. After the little groups of people have finished their
<i>cazuela</i>, the heavy door clashes together.</p>

<p>Beyond the turn of the wall, far down the avenue of palms, the Mendicant
Friars emerge, four by four, and swing off across country for their
daily walk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110">{110}</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IXa" id="CHAPTER_IXa"></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><br />
CONVENTS OPEN AND CLOSED</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Lima</span> is the city of bells. Exuberant wedding carols blend their metallic
jingle with three solemn peals for the dying. Hoarse, ill-cast bells
mingle with bells whose tones drip like honey upon the monks beneath,
who, with cowls thrown back, are pruning monastery gardens, bringing
water to the fig-tree from the fountain. Bells are pitched high and
bells are pitched low. Bells struck from without shake off the clear
ring circling their edges. There are notes with a dry sonority like the
clash of bones. Sharp bells nag the persistent sinner. Soft, sweet bells
lure him to prayer. Quick strokes near at hand only half conceal those
distant thuds, as if the tone had been struck from the atmosphere,
giving “a solemn, religious shimmer to the day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_111" id="page_111">{111}</a></span>”</p>

<p>Though they are more used than those elsewhere, the bells of Lima, it is
said, never grow old.</p>

<p>The tones are of every quality, from the tinkle of little convent bells
calling the sisters to midnight prayer, to the great bell of the
Jesuits, whose “clash, throb, and long swoon of sound” strikes your
chest. Silver and gold in this bell cling to the clear, deep notes
struck from it and pulsate more than half a minute in the tone, which
carries far out over city roofs to sugar-fields and vineyards. The left
tower of San Pedro was built about this bell in 1666 and it cannot be
removed.</p>

<p>San Pedro has three portals on the façade, only allowed for a cathedral.
The story goes that when it was building, permission was asked from Rome
for a portal, which was given of course without delay. When the church
with its three bronze-knobbed doors was finished, the Vatican was
outraged.</p>

<p>“What,” word was sent, “you ask for one door and make three?”</p>

<p>“For two doors one has not to have permission,” came the reply, “only
for three. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112">{112}</a></span> would have had two, anyway; it was for the extra one we
needed to ask.”</p>

<p>The church was finished and consecrated. What could be done?</p>

<p>Monastery bells waken the monks at five o’clock, masses follow every
half-hour throughout the morning. Burials are tolled very early by two
large, discordant bells, struck simultaneously, “a roaring, sinister,
mournful peal.” At noon a great caroling honors the Holy One to whom the
next day is dedicated. After sunset three slow peals boom from all
churches. Old people stand, men take off their hats. At eight sounds the
prayer to the dead, at nine, nine peals from every bell in the city are
an invitation to pray for those who die to-night. This is the time when
the bell in the left tower of San Pedro rings. The left tower of the
cathedral is the home of many owls, which come out at night to cry above
the houses where the sick are lying to warn them of approaching death.</p>

<p>Because innocent voices are intercessors most pleasing to God, Indian
mothers in the mountains prod the poor little savage babies, flopping</p>

<p class="nind">on their backs, with long, pointed, rat-tail silver spoons, so that they
wail intermittently.</p>

<p>In Lima the voice of the bells is lifted to avert catastrophes and to
beg for mercy in times of earthquake. When the bells cease, the
importance of silence is assumed instantly, as with the dropping of the
wind.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>A little jungle of cypress, magnolia, jasmine, pomegranate, and fig
clusters about a fountain which one hears rather than sees. Contralto
bird-notes seem to come from far away, like “the melodious songs of
birds with yellow combs in the blessed land of Aztlan.”</p>

<p>The garden is overgrown with passion-flowers, concealing within their
petals the sacred heart and nails, even the crown of thorns.
Night-blooming cereus hangs darkly above the ground-glass bells of the
floriponda, so ineffably sweet after sundown. Its leaves are narcotic.
(In Lima one is often given a nosegay of jasmine done up in a floriponda
flower.)</p>

<p>I sat waiting on a bench in the cloister garden. Missionary priests were
showing maps to little, fluted nuns. Others in black robes and furry<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114">{114}</a></span>
hats paced up and down the cloister, fondling small missals and stopping
around the corner to gaze at me through the wrought-iron grill.
Mediaeval life in full swing, complete from a glance of the eye to the
jaunty stick cocked under the Don Juan cloak!</p>

<p>One of the priests carried two phosphorescent beetles in a piece of
sugar-cane.</p>

<p>In this convent young girls are taught that a “wife should be loving and
faithful, tolerating the defects of her husband, trying to make herself
esteemed by him, to soften for him the sorrows of life, cultivating
abnegation, evenness of disposition, tolerance, and sweetness. She ought
never to think that the faults of her husband could excuse her own.”</p>

<p>Very different was the Dominican convent of Santa Rosa.</p>

<p>An illuminated manuscript hung at the portal, an absolution for those
who worship here, sent by the Pope several hundred years ago. The recess
in the wall was paved with cobblestones. Antique paintings of saints
hung frameless above. Beside the huge doorway, heavily barred, was a
turnstile in the wall, with solid<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115">{115}</a></span> partitions between the shelves to
prevent a glimpse within. The staring word <i>Paciencia</i> was written above
it. Utter silence!</p>

<p>Rosa Mercédes and I tiptoed through a narrow doorway, under the word
<i>Modestia</i>. We sat on a bench in front of a wooden grill with hexagonal
openings. A vague, distinctive smell drifted through it. On the other
end of the bench a woman was softly sobbing. We waited half an hour or
more.</p>

<p>The week before, the birthday of Santa Rosa had been celebrated in the
cloister where she lived. The week after was now being celebrated here,
where she died. As I listened, there was an explosion of fire-crackers
within.</p>

<p>Beyond a wide space on the other side of the grill was a fine wire
netting, so heavy that only a shade, a brush of a veil, a suggestion of
a smile could penetrate. A soft sound came through the blackness, and a
voice unthinkably sweet said: “<i>Buenos días, Rosa mía</i>.” It was the
Sister Margarita, who had been thirty years behind those bars without a
glimpse of friends, buried to the evils of the world, consecrated to
Santa Rosa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116" id="page_116">{116}</a></span></p>

<p>The voice began to speak.</p>

<p>“Our glorious Rosa! Let me tell you that when she was only three years
old the lid of a heavy chest fell upon her thumb. She looked up at her
mother and smiled. She concealed stinging herbs in her gloves, and when
visitors came, she rubbed pepper into her eyes, so that she could
neither see them nor think of what they were saying. <i>Rosa santísima!</i></p>

<p>“When she sang to her garden the canticle: ‘O all ye green things of the
earth, bless ye the Lord,’ the trees clapped their leaves together, and
even the vegetables lifted up murmurs of praise. She invented hymns to
the Virgin and sang them antiphonally with a bird, though she was often
surprised at being able to understand the speech of unbaptized beings.
One day in the garden a black and white butterfly hovered above her.
Thenceforth she understood that it was decreed that she should enter the
order of Saint Dominicus. Her life from that time on was a series of
acts of self-mortification. <i>Rosa inocentísima!</i></p>

<p>“She divided her day into twelve hours of prayer, ten hours of millinery
work, and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117" id="page_117">{117}</a></span> hours of sleep. She was constantly aware of the presence
of the angels. <i>Rosa purísima!</i></p>

<p>“At sixteen she entered the sisterhood. She prayed to a picture of
Christ until it broke into a sweat. She prepared clothing for the infant
Jesus by prayer&mdash;fifty litanies, nine hundred rosaries, and five days of
fasting made him a little garment; and for toys, she said: ‘I give my
tears, my sighs, my heart, and soul.’</p>

<p>“She wore a belt lined with nails, which she locked about her, and threw
the key down a well. Half the nail belt is in the Santuario of Santa
Rosa, where the well was. It went dry on the day of her death.</p>

<p>“She died here in ecstasy on this very spot at the age of thirty. <i>Rosa
gloriosísima!</i>”</p>

<p>I spoke with the voice. I asked about Santa Rosa’s shrine with its
thousands of little silver <i>ex-votos</i> in Santo Domingo.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is where she lies buried, except once a year on the thirtieth
of August, when she journeys to the cathedral and back.</p>

<p>“The daughter of a viceroy once climbed out of a palace window at night
to take the veil of Santa Rosa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118" id="page_118">{118}</a></span></p>

<p>“When the Pope was deliberating her canonization, he was overwhelmed by
a rain of roses; when it was finally celebrated, the streets of Lima
were paved with silver bars.</p>

<p>“In 1720, when they dug to build her convent, a strong odor of roses
emanated from the ground.</p>

<p>“We keep her roses blooming throughout the year; they grow from the same
roots as those she cared for; the rest of the time we spend in
embroidery and prayer.”</p>

<p>Such a wonderful voice!</p>

<p>The Sister Margarita pressed a parchment-covered book close against the
netting.</p>

<p>“Here is a true life of Santa Rosa. It has never left this monastery.
When you read it, you will understand why I have devoted my life to God
through the mediation of our glorious Saint, our Patron, our Rosa de
Lima.... She stood upon these stones in the courtyard where I now stand.
Can you see why a stone has not been changed?... There is no word in
this book which is not true. I know it by heart. I will give it to
you....</p>

<p>“<i>Es católica?</i>” The voice was suddenly directed toward Rosa Mercédes.</p>

<p>“<i>No, protestante.</i>”</p>

<p>“Oh!...”</p>

<p>Her voice ran down the gamut of the scale.</p>

<p>“You will not then believe my book?” The voice addressed me.</p>

<p>I replied that I should value the book more than any one else to whom
she could have given it.</p>

<p>“Ah,” she sighed, “then that is why I wanted to give it to you.”</p>

<p>A little pause.</p>

<p>“Good-by-ie,” she said. A glint beyond the netting.</p>

<p>“Good-by-ie, <i>mía amíga</i>,” and Rosa Mercédes and I stood alone outside.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>Following is a Salutation to Santa Rosa preceding her novena, published
in Lima in 1902:</p>

<p>“God keep thee, O admirable virgin and patron of ours, Rose of Saint
Mary!</p>

<p>“God save thee, joy of the world, glory of the city, star of Lima, crown
of the fatherland, most rich gold of Peru, treasure of the Indies!</p>

purity, olive of peace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_120" id="page_120">{120}</a></span> fire of charity, most precious pearl, most
beautiful dove!</p>

<p>“We salute thee, O most loved spouse of the Heart of Jesus! Much
cherished daughter of most Holy Mary, living image of thy mistress
Catherine.</p>

<p>“We praise thee, O example of penitence! Chosen from thousands, patron
of a new world.</p>

<p>“We bless thee, O Most Fragrant Rose, Most Precious Rose, Most Innocent
Rose, Most Pure Rose, Most Illustrious Rose, Most Holy Rose, Most

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_Xa" id="CHAPTER_Xa"></a>CHAPTER X<br /><br />
ANOMALIES OF LIMA</h3>

<h4>I</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> sat about the dinner table&mdash;a delightful, stammering, scientific
gentleman, who advised my carrying home some live <i>camarones</i>
(crayfish); a young English curate, here to sketch all the caterpillars
of all the butterflies he could find, and their cocoons; the grandson of
a former president of Peru, who spoke of his grandfather’s battles; and
a cousin of the actual president, who told tales of ostrich-hunting in
the pampas of Argentina, a cosmopolitan club man, whose chief interests
in Lima were cricket and polo. There was a man who was collecting
everything from pearls to reduced heads and whose gold watch-fob was a
Peruvian tongue-weight for the dead. A Chilean lady with the grace of an
older generation spoke of the islands of Juan Fernandez and their
prehistoric monuments, which have a nose and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122" id="page_122">{122}</a></span> chin, face the sun, and
are too big to enter the British Museum. That led toward the
archeologist.</p>

<p>We were eating <i>cuculis</i>&mdash;desert doves&mdash;and alligator-pear salad, while
we listened to stories of pre-Inca civilizations from the man who has
done most to unravel their mysteries. In Peru the alligator-pear is
called <i>palta</i>, a shiny, dark-green, leather-covered shell concealing
its soft, nutty flesh. It hangs at the end of a fine twig, which is
dragged down by its weight. A stiff mayonnaise so disguises the <i>palta</i>
that it is almost impossible to tell where fruit ends and sauce begins.</p>

<p>A lady of mixed races wore twice about her neck a heavily-carved chain,
on her breast the large cross at its end. She spoke of a friend who had
searched for years until he should find a gift exactly suited to her; at
last he beheld this chain about the neck of a pope of the Greek church.
The pope parted with it reluctantly, for in a cavity in the back of the
cross he kept his sacred relics.</p>

<p>She twirled the great cross between her fingers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123">{123}</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Très chic, n’est-ce pas?</i>” she said. “And you see,” touching the clasp
to loosen a little lid, “it’s just the size for a powder-puff!”</p>

<p>A folk-lore-specialist-explorer was discussing swinging bridges in the
Andes with a lady whose husband had left her in Lima while he took a
distant journey in the interior to make a census of savage tribes.</p>

<p>“What have you been doing to-day?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Bless my soul, I don’t remember,” he replied. “Oh, yes! buying slaves
in the jungle.”</p>

<p>Two young English people at the remote end of the table had just arrived
in Lima from a honeymoon adventure up the Amazon. They had sailed as far
as Iquitos; then they had paddled, they had ridden mule-back, they had
tramped over the mountains, and, fording streams to their waists, had
lain down in their wet clothes to sleep in the cold wind. We all
inquired about fever.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said the red-cheeked little lady, “my husband got the fever
one day in Iquitos; it turned his eyes red and his face blue, and the
whole house shook with his chills.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124">{124}</a></span>”</p>

<p>He seemed to like to talk about their adventures. They had been paddling
all one day, he said, and were paddling still, as night settled down
upon the Amazon. Suddenly there was a whirring sound like a great
cataract.</p>

<p>“Paddle for your life,” shrieked the guide, and swinging the canoe
about, they fled down-stream.</p>

<p>The whirlpool! Its encounter the greatest calamity that can befall a
traveler upon the Amazon! No craft, however strong, once caught by the
outermost edge of a whirlpool, can escape. Whether it is caused by a
sudden squall brushing through the forest or a piece of the bank falling
in, is not known. It is certain only that a whirlpool never occurs twice
in the same place.</p>

<p>“Death in that region,” he went on, “is commoner than life. There is a
horrible beast which the natives call a flying snake, with a blue head
and a long prong upon it. It flies sting foremost. You are sauntering
from your hammock to your cabin door. The thing flies against you, and
presto! you fall with the poison of his contact, and another grave must
be dug on the sposhy banks of the Amazon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_125" id="page_125">{125}</a></span></p>

<p>“In Iquitos a woman bears a friend a grudge. She pays the police a small
sum, and the next time her friend emerges, she is bound by the guardian
of the peace, beaten until she falls, and is carried home to die.
Prisoners there are allowed to order their own meals,” he added.</p>

<p>Then came stewed guavas, served with whirls of white of egg and pink and
white pellets.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Nearly</span> everybody makes collections in Lima. In the ancient house of a
marquis, with its court fountain, bougainvillea, and tall Norfolk Island
pine, were benches of ebony with lower rounds worn into hollows by the
feet of nuns; embroidered muslin stoles; queer manuscripts;
tortoise-shell combs tall enough to be filled in with flowers; silver
porringers; and a point lace parasol with a carved ivory handle&mdash;all
relics of vice-regal days.</p>

<p>One room was musty as seventeen mummies could make it. Fifteen <i>soles</i>,
they told us, was the price of a mummy. There were ancient, inlaid
chests filled with cases of butterflies from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126">{126}</a></span> beyond the mountains, huge
snake-skins, overgrown orioles’ nests, necklaces of mummies’ teeth, and
carved cases of <i>huacos</i> dug from Yunca grave-mounds&mdash;the pottery of
mummies. Partly filled with water and rocked back and forth, the quaint
things gave forth the same little half-whistle, half-sigh which notified
their owners a thousand years ago that the precious water was being
stolen. A soft bubbling, somewhere within the clay form, was supposed to
imitate the voice of the animal painted on the outside. The liquids were
meant to refresh a thirsty mummy on his death journey. He still holds
his aching head. But the varnished lips were never parted, and the
gurgling liquid of smoky flavor has never been sipped.</p>

<p>These jars were the ephemeral tablets on which a whole people chose to
leave records of itself. The work of their hands can be held in ours. We
can look into the staring Indian faces or upon the weird animals which
pleased them, shining under a glaze which is the forgotten
accomplishment of those remote tribes.</p>

<p>There are finely drawn portraits of the dead man’s friends, whom he may
have wished as fel<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_127" id="page_127">{127}</a></span>low pilgrims, heads of men and women singing or
smiling, some distorted with pain. The human face twisted to the same
lines then as now.</p>

<p>Wonderful fish glide among aquatic plants, the fox enamored of the moon
languishes along her thin crescent. “The sneaking cat, the sleepy
pelican, the supercilious, impudent parrot,” in softest yellow, white,
red-brown, or black, glance all the iris shades under a purple glaze.</p>

<p>It was not enough to paint the manners and customs of the people, the
fauna and flora of their country; they chose also to represent what they
thought and believed as well as the adjustment of their sandals. We can
peer into their monstrous, often loathsome, mythology and into their
intangible land of fancy. Cats fight with griffins. A lizard with the
face of an owl wears a jacket and bracelets. A chieftain in full regalia
has a girdle ending in a fringe of almond-eyed, many-footed scorpions,
each with a different number of feet. With snakes’ heads as earrings, a
warrior with canine teeth smaller than the snail with forked tongue
beside him is fishing for an octopus with a snake-line, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_128" id="page_128">{128}</a></span> head, as
bait, has caught a man. Crab-hands grasp from ears at a fleeing figure
with a snake-like body, numerous feet intermingle with a human leg, two
arms with nippers, and a fantastic head with waving antennae. A cactus
forms the background.</p>

<p>The sun looks forth from the heart of a starfish. A fanciful eye, all
alone, with unknown appendages and impossible proboscis, glitters under
its dark, lustrous sheen. A ghastly face with wings presides at a dance
of stags. And here is a vessel completely covered by a pair of
elaborated nippers! In it are placed some passion-flowers, a whirl of
purple and black.</p>

<p>Every uncanny suggestion in an animal is worked out to complete
development. We may do the Yuncas the honor to call it allegorical. It
recalls the Mexican legend that “the present order of things will be
swept away, perhaps by hideous beings with the faces of serpents, who
walk with one foot, whose heads are in their breasts, whose huge hands
serve as sunshades, and who can fold themselves in their immense ears.”</p>

<p>It is primarily this portrait pottery which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_129" id="page_129">{129}</a></span> proves the great antiquity
of races in Peru. And the deeper one digs, the finer the designs.</p>

<p>Sitting on the ebony bench with the skin of a jaguar across its back, we
ate <i>dulces</i> (sweets) made of eggs, and drank tea out of ancient
porcelain against a background of embroidered Spanish shawls. A yellow
bird, a <i>cheireoque</i>, who knows everything, sat upon a perch but did not
sing.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Ricardo Palma</span>, Peru’s delightful <i>littérateur</i>, has collected the
national library since its destruction by Chilean soldiers in the late
war. Storekeepers in those days wrapped up their goods in pages of
“fathers of the church.” The Chileans destroyed the annals of the
Inquisition. They also killed the golden oriole which had sung in the
trenches early one morning before the battle had begun.</p>

<p>The distinguished writer of Peruvian traditions sat in his long gown,
reading parchment tomes of bygone centuries, his silk cap pulled down to
his eyes. I sat near him at a table<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_130" id="page_130">{130}</a></span> surrounded by books under a
far-away skylight. There happened to be open a volume of historical
sketches of Limaneans done in color by Pancho Fierro: a man dressed for
the gallows riding beneath balconies of interested ladies; monks and
nuns in every garb; Indian dances with whirls of color; the Lord Mayor’s
procession with his big mace of silver, and black servants in green
velvet holding a red umbrella over his head; every known variety of
eatable-seller; women with bright green trousers, whose veils covered
them all but one eye, and uniforms of every profession and occupation.</p>

<p>About the time when the Puritans were landing in Massachusetts Bay, a
law was passed prohibiting ladies of Lima from covering the face. The
animals of the coachman in whose carriage rode ladies violating this law
would be confiscated, and any man who spoke to such a lady must pay a
hundred <i>pesos</i>. But enforcement of the law was too difficult, and the
custom of the veil persisted until a few years since.</p>

<p>Don Ricardo turned and put into my hands a book of his own. The sun
streamed through the distant skylight. I began to read: “Odo<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_131" id="page_131">{131}</a></span>ray is the
most beautiful blossom of the flower garden of America, a white lily
scented with the breath of seraphim. Her soul is an aeolian harp which
the sentiment of love causes to vibrate, and the sounds which it exhales
are soft as the complaint of a lark.</p>

<p>“Odoray is fifteen years old, and her heart cannot leave off throbbing
before the image of the beloved of her soul. Fifteen and not
love&mdash;impossible! At that age love is for the soul what the ray of
spring sun is to the meadows. Her lips have the red of the coral, the
aroma of the violet. They are a scarlet line above the velvet of a
marguerite.</p>

<p>“The faint tint of innocence and modesty colors her face as twilight the
snow of our cordillera. The locks of hair which fall in graceful
disorder over the ermine of her shoulders, imitate the gold filaments
which the Father of the Incas scattered through space on a spring
morning.</p>

<p>“Her voice is loving and feeling as the echo of the <i>quena</i> (flute). Her
smile has all the charm of the wife in the Song of Solomon, all the
modesty of prayer. <i>Svelte</i> as the sugar-cane<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_132" id="page_132">{132}</a></span> of our valleys, if the
place where it has passed can be recognized, it is not on account of the
trace which its short plant leaves in the sand, but by the perfume of
angelic purity which lingers behind.</p>

<p>“It is an afternoon of April, 1534. Twilight sheds its undivided gleam
above the plains. The sun taking off its crown of topazes is about to
retire on the bed of foam to which the ocean entices it. Creation is at
this instant a lyre letting fall soft sounds. The desirous breeze that
passes giving a kiss to the jasmine, the petal that falls jostled by the
wings of the painted humming-bird, the <i>turpial</i> that sings a song of
agony in the aspen foliage, the sun that sets, firing the horizon ...
all is beautiful. The last hours of the afternoon and all things elevate
the created toward the Creator.</p>

<p>“To hear in the distance the soft murmur of the brook slipping along, to
feel that our temples are brushed by the zephyr filled with the perfume
which is exhaled by the flower of the lemon-tree and the rushy ground,
and in the midst of this concert of nature” ... such is the imagery of
the literature of Peru.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_133" id="page_133">{133}</a></span></p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A woman</span> in lilac called Dolores, a pretty woman with a vapid face, was
absent-mindedly turning a green glass globe between her fingers and
selling guavas. Young soldiers whose swords trailed along the pavement
were eating the guavas.</p>

<p>We got out of the carriage and rattled at a door until a keeper with
jangling keys came to open it. The walls were spiked and covered with
broken glass. The door banged together behind us.</p>

<p>A thin, delicately featured man in a black silk cap and stock came
forward in welcome. “The composer of <i>Ollanta</i>, the national opera,”
some one introduced. He led us toward a bare room scattered with
manuscript music as fine as copper-plate. I looked at the iron bars
across the windows. Over the piano hung three dusty laurel wreaths, the
people’s tribute to a genius they could not understand. After a three
weeks’ presentation by an uncomprehending Italian troupe, Lima demanded
<i>Mignon</i>, and the manuscript opera was returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_134" id="page_134">{134}</a></span> the upper,
right-hand drawer from which its composer now drew it.</p>

<p>“I am transcribing the melodies of the Indians of the highlands, some of
them survivals of Inca days,” he explained.</p>

<p>He played the weird, syncopated music of the Andes, bringing the
indefinable “shiver of unknown rhythm,” the wheedling love-songs and the
sad <i>yaravís</i> which suggested those deep valleys lost among the
mountain-tops.</p>

<p>“You know the <i>yaraví</i> of the Indians? It is a peculiar music, a
melancholy idyl reflecting the somber Indian character&mdash;a music of
extremes, for no other is so dismal and so sweet. It wails in a minor
key through strange Quichua words, the language of the Indians.</p>

<p>“Many of these melodies I have used unchanged. Nothing so speaks to the
spirit as they.... A secret music like that of falling water&mdash;one cannot
hear it without thinking of the riddle of the world. It has a full,
pent-up significance, as when a bird puts all the fervor of its song
into pianissimo. It moves like the music of birds, and like it does not
admit of criticism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_135" id="page_135">{135}</a></span>”</p>

<p>I asked if the Indians sang unaccompanied.</p>

<p>“There is sometimes a reed-flute accompaniment,” he said, “as simple as
the song. The flute is called a <i>quena</i>. Then, too, they play upon a
pipe-of-Pan, supposed to have persisted since Inca days. But melody
suggests to them things far lovelier than they can conceive by words.
What they wish to say is made intelligible by the sadness or
cheerfulness of the tune.”</p>

<p>There is a legend that a priest in early Spanish days loved a beautiful
Indian girl who died. In desolation he mourned for years, until he dug
up her skeleton and made a flute out of the big leg-bone. Then upon it
he played weird, sad tunes and was comforted. This is the origin of the
human-bone flute so widely used.</p>

<p>“Have you ever heard of the ‘Jug of Mourning?’<span class="lftspc">”</span> he suddenly asked.
“Sometimes at evening the Indians play on flutes inserted in a large
earthenware jar to make their tragic tones more resonant, and, sitting
grouped around it at a little distance, they cry aloud and shed tears
for the downfall of the race. The Indians’ misfortune is infinite
indeed, but a misfortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_136" id="page_136">{136}</a></span> terribly uniform; and so is their music. Yes,
even their suffering is consistently monotonous.”</p>

<p>I asked about the libretto of <i>Ollanta</i>.</p>

<p>“It is the only one of the great dramas dealing with exploits of kings,
acted before the Inca by young nobles, still told by the people. Ollanta
was a provincial governor who dared to love a daughter of the Sun and
was commanded not to raise his eyes.”</p>

<p>“Have you had anything published?” I ventured.</p>

<p>“This,” he said, handing me an <i>Elégie</i> bearing a Paris publisher’s
mark.</p>

<p>“Could I find it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. It was out of print long ago.... Now I am working at
<i>Atahualpa</i>, an opera. I consider it by far my greatest work; let me
show you,” and he took some loose leaves from a portfolio.</p>

<p>He began to play again. His whole body swayed to the spectacular rhythm.
There are occasions when rhythm is music, when melody is a refinement
hardly necessary. Everything in nature keeps time to such a rhythm.
Noth<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_137" id="page_137">{137}</a></span>ing can be indifferent. It turns a whole landscape theatrical. We
were whirled up into the midst of the frenzied feather-dance, and beyond
into a lofty sky where condors scarce can breathe. In the distance
glittered the ice-cold <i>puna</i> cities. There is nothing I could not do if
that thrilling moment could have been indefinitely prolonged!</p>

<p>“But you are interested in seeing the boys at work, I feel sure,” he
broke in.</p>

<p>The composer of <i>Ollanta</i>&mdash;sub-manager of a school of correction!</p>

<p>“The boys are either bad or abandoned by their families at an early age.
They are brought here and taught trades. They do all the work of the
school.</p>

<p>“Here is their swimming pool and their dormitory. In their schoolroom
you will see object-lessons upon the walls, pictures of what will befall
them if they are bad.</p>

<p>“The worst thing they can do is to run away. They are put into prison
when they return&mdash;here,” and he unlocked a big door. There were four
little doors on each side of a dark room. Those on the right opened into
closets two feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_138" id="page_138">{138}</a></span> wide and six long, with bars overhead, all painted
black, “to keep them from writing on the walls,” he explained. When the
padlock was removed, the cubby-holes on the left were opened; two feet
square, black.</p>

<p>“Here they must stand.”</p>

<p>I gasped.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“How long do you keep them in such a place? Surely not over night?”</p>

<p>“Not more than eight days.”</p>

<p>“And in the other side?”</p>

<p>“Not over ninety days in there.”</p>

<p>“Is any one in here now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, two,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Certainly</span> nowhere in Peru are contrasts more marked than in Lima of
to-day, with its splendidly carved balconies of former times, its
scavenger birds, and mud roofs strewn with ashes; its dim, candle-lit,
incense-filled churches with their leper windows, and its international
horse-racing; its collections of ancient, battered, gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_139" id="page_139">{139}</a></span> idols, silver
llamas, dishes and spoons, and its aeroplane called <i>The Inca</i>!</p>

<p>Lima is a city where bull-fights are not only an amusement of the
people, but of the finest and best intellects which the country has
produced as well. Bull-fighters with queues, gold and silver embroidery,
lace fronts, and red silk stockings are seen in the streets. Formerly
the archbishop, religious orders, and monks all came to the bull-fights.
The viceroy, shouting “Long live the King,” threw a golden key into the
bull cage, and the fight under most august patronage began.</p>

<p>The market of Lima is a picturesque place: Chilean peppers (<i>aji</i>),
orange and red, pats of goat’s-milk cheese in palm leaves, unsalted
butter in green corn husks, piles of ripe olives of various maroon hues,
strawberries in hand-woven baskets. Fighting cocks glisten in the
intense sunlight. Ladies in mantillas float by, closely followed by boy
servants, their arms full of bundles. Here and there Franciscans with
“sandaled feet and clattering crucifixes” are amassing tribute. There
are said to be about six thousand ecclesiastics now in the city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_140" id="page_140">{140}</a></span></p>

<p>Lima&mdash;with its botanical gardens, condors and llamas in cages, long
<i>allées</i> of royal palms, and its cement tennis courts where English
people are drinking tea; its venerable university, the oldest in
America, and its aimless daily driving around and around the Paséo
Colón; its proverbial milk-women in hand-woven shawls among shining cans
perched high on ponies, and its craze for <i>art-nouveau</i>; its treasuring
of Pizarro’s bony remnant (which a guide explains is “<i>completamente
momificato</i>”) and its earthquake-rooms of solid masonry! Lima&mdash;where one
discusses at some time or another everything from men-of-war to
tapir-skin muffs! Lima&mdash;with its mediaeval festivals, when priests’
chanting fills the streets, incense rises, blossoms fall, and candles
twinkle in a ray of sunlight! As the old saying goes: “It were possible

THE HIGH REGIONS</h3>

<h4>I</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> Peruvian thinks of zones differing from his own as being remote
geographical localities. Peru contains them all. He does not have to
travel over the face of the earth for a change of climate, but makes
short, domestic, vertical journeys instead. Living under his banana
groves among his sugar-fields in the lush coast valley, if he feels need
of fresher air, he takes a trip up to the temperate zone, where apple
orchards and wheat-fields lie spread out in a recess of the mountains,
and strawberries redden to perfection. Has he curiosity to see an arctic
storm, he goes a little higher, coming out upon the bitter table-land
where crests of glaciers cut the sky.</p>

<p>The Andes, youngest of mountains&mdash;what<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_144" id="page_144">{144}</a></span> a weirdly tossed world! All the
most obscure and harsh substances of the planet have been heaped up
here. The rough places of earth have turned over and reached up where
they brush against the firmament.</p>

<p>Volcanic power has its domain in these high regions of earth, where
nature is in anarchy, possessed of unnatural powers. It is a great,
uneasy wilderness, where torrents rattle through daring gorges, only to
fall a thousand feet, scattering into a dust of foam. Icicles hang from
every joint between the stones.</p>

<p>It is a colossal, brutal land, fresh from the cataclysm, whose ponderous
masses of rock are all sterile from cold, all silent under perpetual
snow. In its clearness of atmosphere sparkles a new conception of the
night-time sky. It is a land where thin layers of lichens are the only
trace of plant life, where condors wheel about the highest pinnacles,
and silver lies buried deep in the ground. It is the lair of
mercury-mines which paralyze those working in them, where hot and cold
fountains mingle to make one river, where springs of tar and rivers of
peat ooze from suffocation within.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>A TRESTLE OF THE HIGHEST RAILWAY IN THE WORLD, ACROSS THE
<i>INFIERNILLO</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_145" id="page_145">{145}</a></span></p>

<p>Hot from their passage through the glowing veins of the mountains,
springs bubble into life, sour, turbid, saturated with gases, possessed
of weird powers, capable of giving life as well as of taking it away.
Their waters turn to stone as they spread over the plain. In this frozen
waste of glaciers, sheltering fire and magnetic iron within, all forces
and elements are seething, though shrouded with snow. As the noise of
water fills the desert, so the roar of fire can be heard among the
frozen mountain-tops.</p>

<p>Long, long ago, a volcano was puffing out asphyxiating fumes. It melted
the metal on the edge of its crater, and turned rocks burst from its own
black mouth-pit to red and yellow and green. Fire boiled over the edge
and advanced in a tide of flame down the mountainside and into the
valleys. The favorites of the Sun who lived beside it complained to him
of the ruin caused by the volcano. Somewhat irritated himself, he
“smothered the genius of devastation in his lair,” covering the top of
the mountain with an impenetrable cap of snow, leaving little, seraphic
blue lakes here and there upon it as a hostage. This frozen giant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_146" id="page_146">{146}</a></span>
whose entrails the fire is devouring, still lies sleeping with his
granite dreams.</p>

<p>When all the beneficent qualities inherent in a world have been wrested
from it, and life has disappeared toward experiences elsewhere, or when
a comet’s tail has swished life suddenly away, a wilderness like that of
the high Andes would result&mdash;a place where chaos and disorder is the
only rule. Yet the law of chaos we must believe is no law at all.</p>

<p>Stretched among these mountains is the vast table-land called <i>puna</i>, on
which flourished the Indian civilizations so famous in history. Abundant
rain falls, but cold prevents it from covering the ground with flowers.
Reveling in the high pressure of the mountain-tops, humming-birds flit
about in the snow. The finest morning begets the heaviest afternoon
clouds, and warm atmospheric currents, quite definitely confined in the
cold air, travel through the desolation.</p>

<p>The wind, seeming to tear up the ground and pulverize the summits, is
unable to dissipate a mist which magnifies the rocks and presents the
traveler’s giant shadow with a whole system of concentric rainbow
halos&mdash;his apotheosis in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_147" id="page_147">{147}</a></span> the clouds. The wind brings with it cold
clouds of dust laid only by a fresh fall of snow. It mummifies the
beasts of burden which fall by the way. Mirages, too, the escort of
tropical heat, shimmer upon these arctic plains.</p>

<p>With all the paraphernalia of the torrid zone, limitless vagaries of
torrid force which knows no law of custom, the <i>puna</i> has no enjoyment
of it. For the cold seems also to have taken on the exuberance of
tropical nature.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>You may lose your way in a snow-storm; or in the hot and stifling
valleys, where the tropical sun can concentrate, you may die of the bite
of a venomous serpent. Parched by fever-thirst, you may not drink the
water, for it brings varieties of diseases, bounded by their valleys’
walls.</p>

<p>Your mule may sink into a morass or break his leg in a <i>viscacha</i>
burrow. He may eat a poisonous <i>mala yerba</i> or <i>garbanzillos</i>. Broadly
laden, he may be scraped off a bridle-path clinging to the sheer
precipice. He may be carried away by the swift current of a glacier
stream in attempting to ford it. He may col<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_148" id="page_148">{148}</a></span>lapse from lack of air and
leave you stranded in a lifeless desert. <i>Soroche</i>-sick and burned to a
crisp by the relentless cold, you urge on the staggering mule as he
stops constantly to gulp the thin air. He cannot be satisfied, although
he has a second set of nostrils cut through to ease his breathing and
avert <i>soroche</i>.</p>

<p>Still the glaciers crawl down from brooding peaks above. The sun,
magician of the bleak mountain regions, comes out and glints green on
broken strata of the red mountains. It discovers all the bright colors
in the hills of porphyry and clothes them with fresh shadows. It runs
along a vein of shining mica to accuse it. It plunges into the middle of
a lake of polished jet settled in the snow, “making a great, golden
hole.”</p>

<p>A single hill in sunlight glows with streaks of iris-color, matching the
rainbow forms as they appear above and fade again. Little cloud islets
surround far-off peaks, sunk beneath the horizon. Pyramids of ice
twinkle, and fantastic stone needles stand in rows too precipitous for
snow to cling to their bare sides. They are called early inhabitants,
which Pachacamac in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_149" id="page_149">{149}</a></span> his anger turned to stone. The air, though thin
almost to disappearance, cuts like a razor-edge.</p>

<p>With eyelashes frozen together, you can yet be sunstruck. Teeth to
teeth, cold and heat meet upon “the waste, chaotic battlefield of Frost
and Fire.” Cold is besieged in vain by the sun at its hottest. This land
of silent chaos takes on the cold of outer space so near by, which, shot
through by the fierce heat of the sun, is incapable of absorbing any
warmth.</p>

<p>The magical sun, dispelling somewhat the mountain-sickness, only brings
with it another, even worse. For blazing across the snow-fields in its
tropical fury, <i>surumpe</i> follows, snow-blindness, cured only by fresh
vicuña flesh laid upon the eyes, so the Indians say.</p>

<p>The over-arching vault is indigo. Desolation is brightened by a radiant
light, infinitely attenuated, “diaphanous as the starry void.” It
caresses the bristling scenery. It penetrates caverns and fills them
with a gold and purple mist. In the world of light and shade which it
creates, even the shade gives light. Upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_150" id="page_150">{150}</a></span> water, the light, startled by
its own reflection, sparkles and dances and leaps.</p>

<p>Words give no idea of the brilliancy of the snow on the crests of the
Andes, because there are no words made of sunlight and crystals:
luminous, empyreal snowshine, shattered by the sun now and then into
rainbow colors. As silence is perfect only because it has the
possibility of being broken at any instant by a gigantic crash, so
whiteness is the emblem of perfect purity only because the possibility
of all color lies within.</p>

<p>He who has not galloped across an Andean <i>puna</i> chased by a tempest, has
not known the full, wild force of the elements. Lost in a whirl of
lightning, wind, and snow, his mule, maddened by electricity snapping
off the ends of his ears, dashes from the thunder chasing at arms’
length. Red lightning zigzags between the summits. Blood-red cataracts
tumble over the volcanic crags. Huge pieces of rock break loose and
crash from the cliffs. Deep furrows are ripped up, following the
lightning as it runs along close to the ground.</p>

<p>Lack of air and bitter cold are forgotten.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_151" id="page_151">{151}</a></span> Each flash acts like a fresh
whip-sting to the mule. The compass snaps against its box. Magnetic sand
leaps into the air and flies about in sheets. The rocks seem ablaze, the
whole sky is on fire. The atmosphere quivers with uninterrupted peals,
smothered in the gorges of granite, buffeted by the mountainsides, torn
apart by the high peaks, till, finally overtaking each other, they are
confounded in a mighty burst of thunder that breaks loose in the sky,
and in a cosmic roar reverberates against the nothingness of outer
space.</p>

<p>Then the sun slowly settles in calm. The striped walls flare in the
sunset light, flamboyant as the bang of brass mortars in pagan idolatry.
The mountains shine from base to summit, while “the night, grazing the
soil and step by step raising its wide flight,&mdash;the dying light, fleeing
from crest to crest, makes the most sublime summit resplendent, until
the shadow covers all with its wing.”</p>

<p>All vague sounds subside into an “excess of silence.”</p>

<p>The last incandescent peak shines, and goes out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_152" id="page_152">{152}</a></span></p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> appropriate it is that quicksilver, a liquid heaviest of metals,
should come from this land of contrast. The most elusive product of a
mysterious country, imperceptibly by fumes it enters the nostrils of
those who seek it, either destroying their teeth or disintegrating their
limbs; a metal which, becoming mere vapor, is again transformed by a
sudden chill to metal; though it rises as steam, it falls as
quicksilver. Pliny calls it the poison of all things, the “eternal
sweat,” since nothing can consume it. To the Incas it remained a
mystery, for although its “quick and lively motions” were admired, its
search, being harmful to the seeker, was forbidden. They did, however,
use the vermilion found with it: handsome women streaked their temples
with vermilion.</p>

<p>Silver also is born in certain cold and solitary deserts of the
mountain-tops, melted by subterranean fires within its deep veins.
Silver being the only produce of the soil, the necessities of life have
to be brought from afar. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_153" id="page_153">{153}</a></span> seems as if the vigor that vegetation would
absorb goes into the silver.</p>

<p>The mountain-tops are full of legends of mine discoveries usually
intertwined with romance. Greedy lovers have sacrificed their love for a
mine, and many are the mines filled with revengeful floods. Huira
Capcha, a shepherd who had been guarding his flocks near Cerro de Pasco,
awoke one day to find the stone beneath the ashes of his fire turned to
silver.</p>

<p>It is told in connection with the mine of Huancayo that an Indian friend
gave a Franciscan monk a bag of silver ore. The eager friar wished to
know where more could be found. The Indian consented to show him, but
blindfolded the friar, who took the precaution to drop a bead of his
rosary here and there as he went along. When at last the monk stood
marveling at the bright masses of silver, his Indian friend gave him a
handful of unstrung beads. “Father,” he said, “you dropped your rosary
on the way!”</p>

<p>In 1545, an Indian called Hualpa was pursuing a vicuña up the
mountainside. He grasped at the bushes as he scrambled up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_154" id="page_154">{154}</a></span> steep
cliff. One came up by the roots, which were hung with globules of
silver. That particular vicuña hunt took place on a mountain called
Potosí. The discoverer of the mine of Potosí was murdered by a Spaniard
named Villarroel, who became its proprietor. The murder was an
unnecessary precaution, however, since a mysterious voice had commanded
the Indians to take no silver from this hill, which was destined for
other owners. From that romantic mountain has flowed far “more silver
than from all the mines of Mexico.” “Prior to 1593 the royal fifth had
been paid on three hundred and ninety-six millions of silver.” The only
difficulty the Spaniards encountered was in finding water enough to wash
the silver. The hills about Potosí gleamed with as many as six thousand
little fires, smelting furnaces belching horrid odors, scattering liquid
silver pellets. They had to be carried where the wind blew, sometimes
higher up and sometimes lower down.</p>

<p>So this splendid Imperial City grew up in the subtle air, varied by icy
winds and storm. The extraction of its prodigious wealth was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_155" id="page_155">{155}</a></span> means of
torture to those who worked in continual darkness without knowledge of
day or night.</p>

<p>Yet, even among the tops of the Andes, living things are adjusted to
their environment, queer little animals of the heights giving the only
human atmosphere there is. Leaping <i>viscachas</i>, with cat-like tails,
carve through the frozen ground village burrows made to last forever,
treacherous pitfalls for a traveler’s mule. With the finest, silkiest
fur, valued by even the Incas, chinchillas sit in the shadows, never in
the sun. They appear suddenly on the steep cliffs at dusk and nibble
stiff grasses; then disappear like magic, leaving little chains of
footprints in the snow. A small toad inhabits the boundaries of
perpetual snow, and a nice little plant called <i>maca</i> has its best
flavor only above an altitude of thirteen thousand feet, where all
flavoring ingredients have long been left behind.</p>

<p>The wild gazelle of the Andes, with fur the color of dried roses, the
graceful vicuña, creature of quickness and flight, lives upon the
coldest heaths and in the most secluded fastnesses of the mighty Andes
and seldom de<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_156" id="page_156">{156}</a></span>scends below the limit of perpetual snow. His back, burned
tawny by the tropical sun, is covered with snow.</p>

<p>Far in the distance a flock is grazing. The single male stands near by
upon a rock. A foreign sight or sound, a quick movement of his foot, a
short, shrill whistle vibrating through the clear, <i>puna</i> air, a flash
of golden brown, and the whole flock is lost in the wilderness of rocks,
fleeing miles without stopping. It is said that if the male is wounded,
the females surround him, allowing themselves to be shot down rather
than leave.</p>

<p>The vicuña defies pursuit or capture and disappears at the first glimpse
of intruders, driving the young before him. He is no less wild than in
the days when he was royal purveyor of softest fabric to the Incas’
wardrobes. His habits are as elusive now as then, when Indians thirty
thousand strong entrapped the wild animals among the mountain-tops.
These solemn huntings took place every fourth year. Meanwhile the wise
men kept account of the flocks with colored threads, so-called <i>quipus</i>,
their method of enumeration.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_157" id="page_157">{157}</a></span></p>

<p>Cousins of the vicuña are the awkward <i>huanacus</i>, which drink brackish
water as gladly as fresh and seek a favorite valley where they may
breathe their last and pile up their accumulated bones&mdash;as sea-lions go
to particular islands to die, the wounded being helped thither by
companions. The Incas worshipped the llama, alpaca, and these wild
relatives of theirs; they carved their grotesque forms in stone and
fashioned their likeness in gold and silver for household gods.</p>

<p>Far above the limit of human life, even beyond the haunts of vicuñas,
there is still one living creature. His shadow sweeps over the
wilderness as he passes between it and the sun&mdash;a shadow the only
appearance of life. It is the condor, who lays her white eggs on the
bare rock of the loftiest mountain peaks and knows where the heart of
each animal lies.</p>

<p>The mighty condor, who can kill an ox with his beak of steel, who can
swallow a sheep or exist a month without food.</p>

<p>The majestic condor, who swims in the highest air or sweeps down upon
his prey with a deafening whir of wings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_158" id="page_158">{158}</a></span></p>

<p>The condor, a symbol of light, who circles up to the ether of outer
space on an almost imperceptible, tremulous motion, or proceeds
undisturbed, without effort or flutter of wings, in the icy teeth of a
tempest, a symbol of storm.</p>

<p>He watches the sun rise over a continent-jungle, glimmering with heat
and dampness, and long after the sunset glow has faded from the highest
snowy peak, he sees its fiery ball drop beyond the farthest edge of the
Pacific.</p>

<p>The fabulous condor, known in Europe when Peru was a myth, a hostage
from a fairyland of gold and silver; a griffin which revels in solitude
and in evidences of things gone by.</p>

<p>Loneliness is the condor’s only friend.</p>

<p>The wind howls through his broadened wings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_159" id="page_159">{159}</a></span></p>

Yet there is something with a deeper mystery than all&mdash;the tradition of
a great race that has struggled to a climax and subsided.</p>

<p>Where is there a more unbridled ocean? Where a more pitiless desert?
Where other Andes? Where so limitless a jungle? And where, in the
history of the whole world, so picturesque a dynasty&mdash;whose god was the
Sun, whose insignia the rainbow, who dwelt in houses lined with gold,
who tamed the earth’s resources so that their aqueducts in a rainless<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_160" id="page_160">{160}</a></span>
land are still ministering to the descendants of a people who destroyed
them, and who left not one written word to testify that they had ever
been created at all.</p>

<p>What can be said of the Incas, the theme of romance ever since the greed
of the Spaniard reduced them to a legend&mdash;romances pale indeed beside
facts recorded by sober historians? A people who used copper for iron,
<i>quipus</i> for writing, llamas for horses; who sacrificed condors and
humming-birds to their gods on the frozen plains; whose accumulations of
precious metals exceeded stories of Ophir’s wealth; whose ears were
enlarged that they might better hear the complaints of the oppressed,
and who were brought to destruction by a handful of adventurers whom the
whole training of the people had led them to worship as gods.</p>

<p>Yet the Incas were only the final stage in a series of races that
flourished on the heights of Peru back through the ages. They were but
the last flicker of a guttering civilization without a name, which has
left only a few silent ruins built by unknown peoples, of whom these<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_161" id="page_161">{161}</a></span>
“symptoms of architecture” reveal to us the forgotten existence. The
mystery that fires our imagination in contemplating the Incas had
shrouded their predecessors from them with an impenetrable veil.</p>

<p>Humboldt once remarked that the problem of the first population of
America is no more the province of history than questions on the origin
of plants and animals are part of natural science. In considering this
megalithic age, we have to do with pure speculation, not with any
legitimate domain of knowledge. Learned treatises end only with a
question. Dr. Bingham has recently discovered among these mountains
glacial human bones, possibly twenty thousand to forty thousand years
old. They may shed new light upon the identity of the makers of those
mysterious terraces which appear coeval with the creation of the world.</p>

<p>Vestiges of past civilizations are everywhere about, “monuments which
themselves memorials need;” terraces hollowed out of the mountains to
the very summits, bits of stone walls, roads, aqueducts, or an
occasional stone idol with a shallow vessel for the blood of victims,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_162" id="page_162">{162}</a></span>
perhaps a staring face on a pillar with projecting tusks and snakes
intertwined on its cheeks.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>Tiahuanacu was made by a race which as far antedates the Incas as they
the dominant race to come. Everything to do with it is remote and
forgotten. Of necessity even its name is modern, having been given by
the Inca Yupanqui to his “resting-place.” The great pillars of the City
of the Phoenix rise from the roof of the world, “as strong and as
freshly new as the day when they were raised upon these frozen heights
by means which are a mystery.” Single stones measure thirty feet in
length. Heads of huge statues lie about and hard black stones difficult
to hew, the corners as sharp as when chiseled before the memory of man.
Niches and doorways are cut from the middle of single blocks, whose
corners are perfect right angles.</p>

<p>Many finely sculptured stones are now used for grinding chocolate, some
of the larger ones for making railroads. Prehistoric idols lean as
doorkeepers against flimsy, modern walls in the almost deserted modern
town, and one weird<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_163" id="page_163">{163}</a></span> face has found its way as far as the Alameda in La
Paz. Beyond the protecting opening of a still perfect monolith lies the
burial-place for still-born Christian children.</p>

<p>A monolithic doorway, beautifully sculptured, lies broken in two by
lightning. A square-headed, legless, impenetrable god, speaking from
right-angled lips, still stares from behind his square eyelids. Weeping
three square tears from each eye, he surveys the waste and desolation
about him, just as he looked unmoved upon the golden pageants of Inca
days that did him honor as a superhuman deity who had sprung into being
in one night with a whole city about him. His hands wield snaky-necked
scepters, each the head of a condor, the lightning bird; and rows of
square little worshippers in wings and condor-fringes kneel beneath
crowns of rays fading off into the heads of birds with reversed combs.</p>

<p>No one yet knows the meaning of the sculptured deity which confused Inca
<i>amautas</i> (wise men) a thousand years ago. Though the Creator is
supposed to have lived in Tiahuanacu, an eminent German, Rudolph Falb,
says the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_164" id="page_164">{164}</a></span> weeping god is a hero of the flood, his tears the symbol of
the deluge.</p>

<p>A tradition of the sixteenth century ascribes these monuments to an age
before the appearance of the sun in the heavens. Their builders were
destroyed by a flood sent by the wrathful god, Con Tici Uiracocha, who
came from the south, converting “heights into plains and plains into
tall heights, causing springs to flow out of bare rocks.” Half in regret
that he had destroyed his race of men, he created sun and moon to render
visible the waste he had made.</p>

<p>This information is as accurate and authentic as any which a long line
of distinguished explorers and archeologists have been able to
substitute for it. Men of sane judgment agree in admitting that there is
nothing to justify any conclusion. But they also agree that the
significance of Tiahuanacu exceeds everything hitherto discovered in
Peru. It recalls Carnac and Philae. It stands with the dolmens of
Brittany, Stonehenge, and the cyclopean terraces of the South Sea
Islands, as a great riddle of human history.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dropped</span> in the bottom of yawning red gulfs, with snow-peaks glistening
overhead, are wild valleys of differing climates, the mighty <i>quebradas</i>
of the Andes. These canyons, which the famous hanging bridges used to
span, intersect the wilderness. They lie in dusk while the over-arching
cliffs are bathed in full sunlight, for sunrise and sunset are within a
few hours of each other. The warm air, steaming upward, pushes the snow
boundary far above. Strata of black sand on the valley’s walls have been
tunneled by cave-dwellers of ancient times. French sisters of charity
move about in cloisters under eucalyptus trees.</p>

<p>Such a surprise is Yucay, tucked in snugly between two mountains,
wrapped in soft air and scents of unknown flowers, the loveliest spot in
all the empire of the Incas. Streams of clear water descend to it from
above and form the smooth, deep river of Yucay. The Incas sought it out
for their gardens of pleasure and were lulled to rest by bells of gold
tied to the hammocks in which they slept.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_166" id="page_166">{166}</a></span></p>

<p>Water has a very tranquillizing effect. It sweeps along a valley, and
the jagged remnants of volcanic action are smoothed out into long
undulating lines.</p>

<p>Water collects in all crevices; lakes green as iron vitriol, fed by
subterranean springs, lie in the surly country like jewels in their
setting. When night shadows have settled in the valleys, the alpine glow
is reflected in the quiet surface.</p>

<p>There are no fish in the lake of Chinchaycocha, Laguna de Reyes. Though
their element is water and they die in air, here they die in pure water
for lack of air. The <i>ingahuallpa</i> sings a monotonous note from the bank
at the close of every hour during the night. The outlet of the lake is
narrow and deep, and its clear water flows smoothly and without noise.</p>

<p>All the lakes have their secrets. The little lake of Orcos still holds
the golden chain with links wrist-thick made by Huayna Ccapac at the
birth of his eldest son. It encompassed the market-place of Cuzco. It
was so weighty that “two hundred Indians having seized the links of it
to the rings in their ears were scarce able<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_167" id="page_167">{167}</a></span> to raise it from the
ground.” After the coming of the Spaniards, it was thrown for
safe-keeping into this round, deep pool filled by unknown springs. Safe
indeed it is. Orcos has not given up its charge, though repeated
attempts have been made to reach the bottom. Trying to drain it by a
sluice and trench, the Spaniards “unhappily crossed upon a vein of hard
rock, at which, pecking a long time, they found that they struck more
fire out of it than they drew water"&mdash;the opposite element from the one
they expected.</p>

<p>Up against the sky lies a sea where men sail in boats of grass&mdash;Lake
Titicaca, where ships are silently struck by lightning without crash of
thunder. On these high seas the navigator has to go by instinct, because
of the loadstone round about&mdash;magnetic iron, it is now less
picturesquely called. Saint Elmo’s fire blazes from ships’ masts on
stormy nights. Sometimes a pointed tongue of black clouds swings from
above, “like the trunk of some gigantic elephant searching the ground.”
A similar one raises itself from the surface of the water, slapping back
and forth, seeking the point of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_168" id="page_168">{168}</a></span> tongue above, and when they have
found each other, they join in a mighty, black column, out of which
burst thunder and lightning. It whirls off everything within reach and
sucks down a passing <i>balsa</i> (boat of reeds) into a depth never sounded.</p>

<p>The water of Lake Titicaca is ice-cold and brackish. Its strangely
fashioned fishes never come to the surface. It is inhabited by great
animals like sea-cows, occasionally seen resting on a beach of some
remote inlet. The grottoes along the shore are guarded by gray and black
night herons and inhabited by the sea-cow or other monsters!</p>

<p>Queer birds haunt the wide stretches of <i>totora</i> growing along the
shore, reeds whose stems are used for making boats, and whose tips are
used as salad. Here live the stately <i>puna</i> geese, dazzling white, with
green wings shading into violet; black water-hens, white <i>quinlla</i>, dark
green <i>yanahuico</i> with long, thin, bent bills, finely etched ducks,
ibises, <i>licli</i>, metallically bright, and sea-gulls from the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Coal is found on the shores of Titicaca, which suggests a mystery. At
what elevation could<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_169" id="page_169">{169}</a></span> tropical coal plants grow? The bones of mastodons
are also here. But rocks even higher up are smoothed as if by waves, and
beaches are found like those of the actual sea. Both Humboldt and Darwin
found shells, once crawling on the bottom of the sea, now embedded
fourteen thousand feet above its level.</p>

<p>Small lakes are sources of small rivers, by which they are emptied. But
great Titicaca forms no stream at all. Its outlet has no outlet of its
own. The rush of nauseous water is poured into a shallow lake-twin not
far away&mdash;Poopo, through whose mysterious whirlpools the water drops
back again in subterranean escapes. This tumultuous torrent, the
Desaguadero, was spanned in former days by a bridge of reeds.</p>

<p>Recent measurements show that the level of these two lakes is constantly
lowering, and eventually they will disappear. They were once the source
of the greatest river in the world, but some day there will be only a
salty deposit in the hollows they now fill.</p>

<p><i>Titi</i>, the cat, <i>kaka</i>, the rock, Lake Titicaca was named for a little
island within it, around<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_170" id="page_170">{170}</a></span> which cluster legends of the origins of
things. It was the most revered shrine in the empire of the Incas.
Neither the wide fields of Chita, where the flocks of the Sun gamboled,
nor the valley of Yucay could equal this enchanted isle of Titicaca.</p>

<p>Before the arrival of man, the island was inhabited by a tiger, carrying
on its head a magnificent ruby, whose light illuminated the whole lake
as the afterglow the snow-covered peaks above. The Hawaiians have an
expression for the shifting of colors in a rainbow. The Indians on Lake
Titicaca have special words for the glow of fading sunlight on the
mountain summits and the purple of the glaciers in their hollows.</p>

<p>The Sun had preserved himself from the flood by hiding in the depths of
Lake Titicaca. This was his island, out of whose sacred rock, after the
deluge, he soared like a big flame into the sky. His footsteps are still
to be seen perpetuated in iron ore. The original Incas were let down by
the Sun, their father, on to the small island and commanded to go forth
to teach the savage inhabitants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_171" id="page_171">{171}</a></span></p>

<p>But the worship given this spot by the Incas was only absorbed in that
of former times. This “Island of the Wild Cat” is a field of aboriginal
myth and tradition.</p>

<p>The sacred cliff where the Sun had risen was covered by the Incas with
sheets of gold and silver, “so that, in rising, he might see the whole
rock ablaze, a signal to worship.” “Sixteen hundred attendants
manufactured <i>chicha</i> to throw at it, and pilgrims from the entire
empire brought offerings of silver and gold.” Garcilasso says that
“after all the vessels and ornaments of the temple were supplied, there
was enough gold and silver left to raise and complete another temple
without other material whatsoever.” All the treasure was thrown into
Lake Titicaca to save it from the Spaniards. Ten of them were drowned in
1541, while hunting for it. Titicaca guards its secrets well.</p>

<p>The approach to the temple was a very complicated structure known as
“the place where people lose themselves.” The pilgrims, after much
fasting on the sacred ground of the island, were allowed to pass
barefoot through the first gate above, the “door of the puma,”
<i>puma<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_172" id="page_172">{172}</a></span>puncu</i>. After more fasting, they might go down through the second
gate, the “door of the humming-bird,” <i>kenti-puncu</i>, so called from
feathers of humming-birds plastered over its inner side. They were
especially honored by the Incas, colored like the rainbow emblem. After
more ceremonies, the pilgrims were allowed to go through the “door of
hope,” <i>pillco-puncu</i>, covered with feathers of the bird of hope. Those
who had come so far might now worship the holy cliff, but they were not
allowed to touch the face of the cliff nor to walk upon it. Sacrifices
to it were small children, whose heads the priests cut off with sharp
stones. The sacrificial stone of the Island of Titicaca still remains,
rubbed smooth by the iron tooth of time, split into three pieces by a
thunderbolt. So does the queen’s meadow below the terraces, where the
carmine, yellow, and white <i>cantut</i>, <i>flor-del-Inca</i>, recalls the
blazing color of other days, when fruit ripened here twelve thousand
feet above the sea, and maize of which Sun-virgins made the bread of
sacrifice.</p>

<p>Beyond, is the island called Coati, consecrated to the Moon, where her
temple used to be. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_173" id="page_173">{173}</a></span> life-size statue of a woman was found here, gold
in the upper half, silver in the lower.</p>

<p>The Fountain of the Incas still gushes two streams of clear water. “A
stolid Indian sits watching it pour away, never dreaming whence it
comes, as no one, indeed, knows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_174" id="page_174">{174}</a></span>”</p>

MYTHS AND MONUMENTS</h3>

<h4>I</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Indian worshipped the Inca, his sovereign, because of his divine
origin, being the descendant of Manco Ccapac, founder of his race, who
was the son of the Sun. Thus, religion was the substance of the empire.
But as the Temple of the Sun at Cuzco was a pantheon of idols, sacred
each one in the mind of some visiting chieftain, though always remaining
the Sun Temple, so the religion itself was a synthesis of all the
beliefs which those idols represented; blended yet dominated by the
all-searching light of the Sun. This may explain, for instance, the
confusion of Pachacamac, the supreme deity of the ancient coast tribes,
with Uiracocha of the mountains, whom Acosta, among others, declares to
be one and the same. Clear-cut</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_175" id="page_175">{175}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">distinctions are impossible. The stories are all vague, even among
confident writers of legends.</p>

<p>As to the Sun’s descent, the wise men of the Incas learned from their
predecessors that he was made by The Ancient Cause, The First Beginning,
The Maker of All Created Things, The Supreme Deity, Illa Tici Uira
Cocha&mdash;the four ultimate, visible forms of the Infinite, to quote the
<i>Peruvian Star-chart</i> of Salcamayhua. There is in Quichua a word to
express “the-essence-of-being-in-general-as-existent-in-humanity.”
Sometimes the name is given as Con Tici Uiracocha, an identification
with the supreme god, Con, the center of another group of legends of
belief. The mystery surrounding this great, invisible god, generally
called Uiracocha, is as complete now as it was to the Sun-worshipping
Incas, a sort of dim background for the glittering splendor of
Sun-ritual.</p>

<p>Uiracocha has many identities: Uiracocha, the Supreme God; Uiracocha,
the hero-god, the white and bearded man in long robes, who with a
strange animal in his hand, appeared to that Inca afterwards called by
his name, tending the flocks of the Sun among the tops of the Andes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_176" id="page_176">{176}</a></span>
Uiracocha, who raised up an army for the Inca on the Field of Blood out
of stones that he set on fire from a sling of gold; he who changed the
revelers of Tiahuanacu to stone in wrath. (However misty the connection
between Uiracocha, stones, and human beings, it is certain that
Peruvians held stones in great awe. The temple to Uiracocha, the
war-god, is at the foot of an extinct volcano whence a lava stream had
issued. It is paved with black and made of carved and polished stone.
The interior was obscure, with an altar for human sacrifices.) Uiracocha
who, as Betanzos relates, came out of a lake when all was dark, lord of
light and lord of wind, who, as dawn appeared, spread his mantle over
the waves of the lake and was wafted away into the rays of morning
light. The curling waves followed his evanescent passage, and so he was
called Uiracocha, the Foam of the Sea. He gave his wand to the chief in
the House of the Dawn. It afterwards became the golden staff of Manco
Ccapac, his son.</p>

<p>Uiracocha was the universal god of the Quichua-speaking people. The Sun
was peculiar to the Incas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_177" id="page_177">{177}</a></span></p>

<p>The hazy red deity Con was the personification of subterranean fire. “He
is light as air, has neither arms nor legs, nor muscles nor bones, nor
joints nor nerves nor flesh, but runs very fast in all directions.” He
came from the sea and flattened the hills and filled up the valleys, and
by his simple word gave life to man. Viciously he converted the race of
men he had created into black cats and other horrible animals,
devastated the earth, deprived it of rain, and&mdash;retreated into the sea.
His first temple was a volcano.</p>

<p>This left a free field for his equally omnipotent, equally hazy brother
Pachacamac, who benignly created another race of men. Since Pachacamac
was invisible and beyond their conception, the Incas built him no
temples, but gave him secretly a superstitious worship, bowing their
heads, lifting their eyes, and kissing the air as evidences of the
reverence they felt at the mention of his name.</p>

<p>Here is a prayer reported by Geronimo de Ore: “O Pachacamac, thou who
hast existed from the beginning, and shalt exist unto the end, powerful
and pitiful; who createdst man<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_178" id="page_178">{178}</a></span> by saying, ‘Let man be;’ who defendest
us from evil, and preserves! our life and health;&mdash;art thou in the sky
or in the earth, in the clouds or in the depths? Hear the voice of him
who implores thee, and grant him his petitions. Give us life
everlasting, preserve us, and accept this our sacrifice.”</p>

<p>The Inca mind could not reconcile the anterior existence of Uiracocha,
Con, and Pachacamac with Sun-supremacy. We find them all called sons of
the Sun, and so their importance could consistently fade away.</p>

<p>The origin of the two first Incas was mystery-veiled. Men discussed
whether they were saved from the primeval waters robed in garments of
light, or whether they came from three shining eggs laid by the
lightning in a mountain cave after the deluge. Did they escape from the
lower world through a giant reed, or were they imprisoned in a cave,
over which Uiracocha appeared with wings of brilliant feathers to give
Manco Ccapac the insignia&mdash;the scarlet fillet and the round gold plates?
Some thought they emerged from Paccari-tampu, the Lodgings of the Dawn,
not far from Cuzco. They had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_179" id="page_179">{179}</a></span> led thither through caverns of the
earth. Sarmiento relates that the Incas came out of a rich window, by
order of Uiracocha, without parentage. The first Inca had an enchanted
bird and a staff of gold, and came conferring fairy-tale benefits to
mankind.</p>

<p>The legend most widely accepted taught that the Incas, who in the person
of Manco Ccapac and his wife and sister Mama Ocllo came out of the cave
of Paccari-tampu, were children of the Sun. He himself placed them on
the Island of Titicaca and told them to wander until they should reach a
place where their wedge of gold would be swallowed up by the ground at a
touch. There they should build the capital of their empire. At the foot
of the fortress of Sachsahuaman it disappeared, and so the city of
Cuzco, the Navel of the World, was founded.</p>

<p>The poetic fiction of all these legends conceals an historic background
of curious details. But with Father Acosta we should consider that “it
is not matter of any great importance to know what the Indians
themselves report of their beginning, being more like unto dreams than
to true histories.” He continued: “They<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_180" id="page_180">{180}</a></span> believe confidently they were
created at their first beginning at this new world where they now dwell.
But we have freed them of this error by our faith, which teacheth us
that all men came from the first man.”</p>

<p>Besides all this maze of divinity and a symbolic astronomy, everything
in nature had for them a soul that they might pray to for help. Not only
the sun, moon, stars, thunder, and lightning, the rainbow, the elements,
and rivers, but that deep sea from which they issued had a mysterious
worship. They adored high mountains, homes of majestic gods whom they
never saw, whence streams proceeded to water their terraces. They
sacrificed to distant objects by blowing the ashes of burnt sacrifices
into the air, offering them to the hills and to the wind. They adored
all great stones, the mouths of rivers, all things in nature different
from the rest, and offered to them small stones or a handful of earth or
an eyelash.</p>

<p>Moreover, there was an elaborate fetishism. They had idols with a
personal interest; they carried talismans; they had miniature domestic
altars, where they offered <i>chicha</i> or flowers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_181" id="page_181">{181}</a></span></p>

<p>They tried to appease things that might injure them. They drank a
handful of water from a dangerous river before crossing, and ate a bit
of the stone which had harmed them, and offered in sacrifice a leaf of
coca. The mysteries of coca epitomize the country where it grows. It not
only fortifies the teeth, controlling mountain sickness, preventing
fatigue, keeping off disease, strengthening broken bones; it cheers the
spirit and invigorates the mind, and gives courage to perform impossible
tasks.</p>

<p>Its juice softens hard veins of metal. The odor of burning coca
propitiates the deities-of-metals, who would render the mountains
impenetrable without it. Coca-leaves in the mouths of the dead insure a
welcome in lands beyond.</p>

<p>No wonder it was the divine plant of the Incas. A sacrifice at
festivals, its smoke an offering to the gods, whose priests chewed the
solemn herb to gain their favor, it was a benediction for any
enterprise. Mama-coca, its spirit, was worshipped.</p>

<p>Coca, preferred to gold, silver, or precious stones, was dubbed by the
Spaniards “<i>una elusión del demonio</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_182" id="page_182">{182}</a></span>”</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Almost</span> as well known as the stories of silver and gold from Peru are
those relating to its mammoth buildings made of mammoth stones. The
ruins are a better witness to the greatness of the ancient Peruvians
than the wealth looted from them.</p>

<p>It is the first fact mentioned by a homecoming traveler that there is a
twelve-cornered stone in the Street of Triumph in Cuzco, and into and
around each corner other stones are so perfectly fitted that a
knife-blade cannot be inserted between them. That fact is perfectly
true. So also is the fact that ancient Peruvians transported stones
weighing tons with llamas and human beings as their only beasts of
burden. They lifted them to great heights without machinery, cut them
without steel implements, blasted them without gunpowder, and polished
by rubbing them with other stones and bundles of rough grass. They had
no resources in building but their own energy. The vast “stones were
raised by social<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_183" id="page_183">{183}</a></span> institutions, supplying want of instruments by numbers
of people.” This world of ruins, comparable to Egypt, “is isolated in
the region of the clouds.”</p>

<p>Stupendous scenes upon these elevated plains were object
lessons&mdash;nearness of gigantic peaks, appalling depth of chasms. The
Incas learned much from nature: from salt-strewn deserts to lay waste
their criminals’ property, sowing their fields with salt; from the sea,
maker of terraces. They finished off the mountain-sides with small
<i>andenes</i>, or hanging gardens, which received the flow of water bestowed
by the Inca upon his subjects with every patch of ground. They brought
loam from the jungle in baskets and created land upon bare rocks. Where
opportunity offered, the terraces widened, following the natural
excrescences of the mountain.</p>

<p>And when nature failed to point lessons, models were provided by
far-receding civilizations so remote that they almost seemed to have
relapsed into the domain of nature. Each served as the foundation for
the next, like the rhythmic life of the jungle.</p>

<p>Ancient Peruvians hesitated at nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_184" id="page_184">{184}</a></span> They built an artificial city
on a high, cold, almost waterless, plain, with a palace for the Inca to
visit in, a garrison for his protection, and magazines and granaries for
his soldiers’ food. Countless royal palaces, too, their niches covered
with plates of gold, and convents like the House of the Virgins of the
Sun in Cuzco, were duplicated all over the empire for other wives of the
Inca as he chose among them, “storehouses sheltering his tribute in
women.” There were baths and fountains and places of pleasure and round
stone <i>chulpas</i>, towers of the dead.</p>

<p>Since no one traveled except by order of the Inca, the highways were
reserved for himself, the armies, and the <i>chasqui</i>, or royal runners.
From Zarate to Humboldt, they have been described as fit to rank with
the seven wonders of the world. One highway pierced walls of solid rock,
crossing profound chasms and the treacherous marshes of the <i>puna</i> on
walls of solid masonry. Being a pedestrian road, it slipped in flights
of stone steps over the brow of the mountains. It traversed the whole
empire for two thousand miles among the mountain-tops. The other,
flanked by mud walls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_185" id="page_185">{185}</a></span> lay along the low deserts of the coast, “shaded
by trees whose branches hung over the road loaded with fruit, and filled
with parrots and other birds,” to quote Cieza de Leon. Humboldt said
that “part of the coast road was macadamized.”</p>

<p>At regular intervals, “every ten thousand paces,” <i>tambos</i> were
scattered along the roads, houses of pleasure for the Inca and
waiting-houses for the relays of messengers of the Sun as they bore news
of royal necessity, or brought fish from the sea or other delicacies
from distant provinces to the Inca’s table. Garcilasso describes the
stone stairs up to these inns “where the chairmen who carried the sedans
did usually rest, where the Incas did sit for some time taking the air,
and surveying in a most pleasant prospect all the high and lower parts
of the mountains, which wore their coverings of snow, or on which the
snow was falling, for from the tops of some mountains one might see a
hundred leagues round.”</p>

<p>The Incas threw a swinging osier-bridge of spider-web construction
across a vicious torrent to lead their armies over. So-called
historians<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_186" id="page_186">{186}</a></span> tell of bridges of feathers used in Inca days, but, as
Garcilasso adds, “omit to declare the manner and fashion of them!”</p>

<p>The secrets of the Inca ruins are not yet told. For their industry
moulded underground as well, connecting palaces and convents by hidden
passageways, and chambers and depositories for army supplies like those
made by the great Yupanqui in his campaign against the Chimus.</p>

<p>The subterranean system of water-works was stupendous. Near Cajamarca is
a channel several hundred miles long paved with flagstones throughout
its entire length. It forms the outlet to a little lake. Another
aqueduct traversed the whole province of Cuntisuyu, twelve feet deep and
over one hundred and twenty leagues long, leading waters of the snows to
barren plains. Water was stored in cisterns on the mountain-tops. “They
conducted rivers in straightened channels through hills of solid rock,”
they brought water through pipes of gold from distant hot and cold
springs, whose sources are now unknown. It trickled into the baths of
the Inca through golden jaws of animals, birds, or snakes, and then
welled</p>

</div>

<p class="nind">over through properly regulated pathways to the terraces, where growing
things were in want of irrigation.</p>

<p>This civilization had taken ages to evolve, as the development of
certain plants and animals alone would show. It was reduced in a few
years to an empire of ruin. One shivers at the “hideous energy of
destruction evinced by man.” But in spite of all that has been done to
annihilate the achievements of the Incas, benefits accruing from them
still remain. “Makers of ruins” indeed, yet by them the present flimsy
civilization exists. Upon their terraces, climbing to the mountain-tops,
Indians now live in mud huts, little towns clutching at a far-off slope,
apparently deserted but for the cemetery. Irrigating prospectors stand
aghast before their mighty systems. The railway builder may take lessons
in road construction.</p>

<p>There is practical value in ruins, if from them comes inspiration for
modern industry. And there is poetry in ruins, because they speak of men
and things which are gone, never to return, “the shrines of by-gone
ideals, makable when they were made and then only.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_188" id="page_188">{188}</a></span>”</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IVb" id="CHAPTER_IVb"></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><br />
THE INCA AND HIS EMPIRE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> one dared to look upon the Inca, as he radiated the light of his
divine Sun-father. He lived and ruled as a deity, representative of God,
supreme arbiter of all creatures breathing the air or living in the
water. “The very birds will suspend their flight if I command it,”
Atahualpa once said. His person being holy, his body after death,
preserved in its living likeness, was still worshipped. Carried about on
a golden litter, the Prince Powerful in Riches moved from palace to
palace, and his feet never touched any but sacred ground, consecrated by
his contact, if not previously hallowed. To carry his person was so
singular an honor that his weight was not a burden, as cultivating his
fields was a labor performed with hymns of joy. This Sun of Cheerfulness
passed beneath flower-covered arches, while his bearers crushed out
sweet odors from flowers beneath their<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_189" id="page_189">{189}</a></span> feet. Indeed, “the shouts of the
multitude as he passed along caused the birds flying over to fall to the
ground!”</p>

<p>If these “facts” seem more like romance than truth, they have at least
masqueraded under the guise of history for more than three hundred
years.</p>

<p>The Inca was clothed in garments made of the silky hair of the vicuña,
which lives above the line of perpetual snow. Woven as they were to be
worn, from threads of invisible fineness, the soft garments were made by
cloistered Virgins of the Sun. They were enriched with bits of gold,
silver, emeralds, a fringe of gorgeous feathers, and with
mother-of-pearl. Pearls were not used, as their “search endangered the
lives of the seekers.” The Inca wore a suit but twice, then conferring
it upon some person of royal blood. These were the garments taken as
sumptuous gifts to the monarchs of Spain.</p>

<p>Many were the Incas’ marks of distinction. Their heads were shorn, all
but one lock, as Manco Ccapac had ordained. The “shearing” was done by
means of a sharp flint. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_190" id="page_190">{190}</a></span> distinction was enlarging the velvet of
the ear by inserting ornaments, so that it reached the shoulder,
suggesting the Spanish title, <i>Orejones</i>.</p>

<p>The peculiar badge of the Inca was a fringe encircling his brow, called
the <i>llautu</i>, “the mark whereby he took possession of the realm, a red
roll of wool more fine than silk, which hung in the midst of his
forehead.” And his chief distinction, worn in his colored wreath and
pointing upward, were the two long pinions of the <i>corequenque</i>, that
mysterious pair of birds which, isolated in a snowy desert beside a
little lake, lived at the foot of an inaccessible mountain. Though there
are other snowy deserts and other little lakes and other inaccessible
mountains, no similar pair of birds could ever be found. In fact, there
never were but two alive at the same time&mdash;symbol of the two original
parents. They recall the screaming <i>oo</i>, a blackbird of the Hawaiian
Islands, famed for concealing under each wing a single yellow feather,
used in making those magical feather cloaks for the kings on ceremonial
occasions.</p>

<p>Each Inca must have new pinions, as each must have his new palace, for
the apartments<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_191" id="page_191">{191}</a></span> of a dead sovereign were closed at death; his golden
utensils, jewels, and treasure were buried with him. Men and women,
practised in the art of lamentation, cried for one year after his death,
when his account was closed. Then the heir “bound his head with the
colored wreath” and started forth through his dominions.</p>

<p>With the rainbow as their emblem, even Inca facts had distinctive colors
and were interwoven with facts of other colors, ideas being expressed
directly without the technique of words. Knots in a parti-colored twist
were their hieroglyphics, the famous <i>quipus</i>, and the Officers of the
Knots were their historians. They intertwined the bright filaments of
different sizes as well as colors, and tied into remembrance everything
from laws and army supplies to ballads of the poets, sung on days of
triumph.</p>

<p>Such a Sovereign-deity as the Inca could force the equality of all his
people, commanding them to be happy. Here was a whole nation moved by
sameness of will&mdash;desire to please their sovereign. Observance of law
was natural to these industrious subjects, who were treated with
absolute justice by an absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_192" id="page_192">{192}</a></span> despot. Each was just as well fed, just
as well clothed, just as well housed, just as well amused, as his
neighbor. Emissaries from the king inspected his neighbor to see that it
should remain so. All persons had to allow messengers from the Inca to
inspect what they were doing at any time. Such as were found commendable
were praised in public. Such as were idle and slovenly were scourged on
the arms and legs. One punishment was whipping by a deformed Indian with
a lash of nettles.</p>

<p>“There never could be any scarcity or famine, for, if a man failed to
take his turn at the water for irrigation, he received publicly three or
four thumps on the back with a stone ... shamed with the disgraceful
term of ... <i>mizqui tullu</i>, being a word compounded of <i>mizqui</i>, which
signifies sweet, and <i>tullu</i>, which is bones.”</p>

<p>As labor was the only tribute, the rich were not taxed more than the
poor. The blind were required to cleanse cotton of seeds and rub maize
from the ears. “The old men and women were set to affright away the
birds from the corn, and thereby gained their bread and clothing.” No
one, however impotent, could</p>

<div class="caption"><p>INDIAN WATER CARRIER, SICUANI.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_193" id="page_193">{193}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">escape tribute. The poorest gave lice, “making themselves clean and not
void of employment in so doing.” Who, indeed, were the poor? Those who
were incapable of work, who had to be fed and clothed out of the king’s
store.</p>

<p>“There were no particular tradesmen ... but every one learned what was
needful for their persons and houses and provided for themselves.”</p>

<p>Laws would hardly seem necessary to control so exemplary a nation. Here,
however, are a few paternal laws, thought necessary by the Lover of the
Poor: against the adornment of clothing with gold and silver and jewels;
against profuseness in banquet and delicacies in diet; against the ill
manners of children; of good husbandry and hospitality; providing a new
division of lands every year, according to the increase and diminution
of families; punishing those who destroyed landmarks or turned the water
aside; devoting the services of all master workmen to the Inca, and
supplying them with gold and silver and other materials for the exercise
of their ingenuity.</p>

<p>Since the Sun-god, or the Inca, had be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_194" id="page_194">{194}</a></span>nignly bestowed them for the
people’s good, laws received the same veneration as the precepts of
religion, from which no subject of the Incas could dissociate them. A
breaker of the law was guilty of sacrilege, and no punishment could be
too severe. In fact, most crimes were punishable by death. The sinner
was thrown over a precipice or into a ditch of serpents, jaguars, and
pumas. The worst sin of all, high treason, exacted in expiation not only
the death of the sinner, but that of his family, even of his neighbors.
His very trees were pulled up by the roots, and his fields sown with
salt. “But as there was never any such offense committed, so there was
never any such severity executed,” a mitigating remark of Garcilasso in
connection with a certain crime.</p>

<p>The basis of the Inca government was tribute, personal labor given to
the Sun and to the Inca, a source of continual delight, a supreme
privilege. So the Sun, or his representative the Inca, was furnished by
his people with food, tilled by them from his own ground; clothing for
his soldiers or his needy from the wool of his own flocks; bows and
arrows, lances and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_195" id="page_195">{195}</a></span> clubs, ropes for carrying burdens, helmets and
targets each where most easily procurable. Temples and palaces of the
Inca, his aqueducts, roads, and bridges were built with hymns of
rejoicing. The laborers never got out of breath so as to spoil the
cadence of the hymn of triumph; the chroniclers fail to say whether in
obedience to law or from a sense of good taste.</p>

<p>In addition, all the provinces paid tribute of the most beautiful women,
who were kept in convents as wives of the Inca; and he might choose any
who suited him.</p>

<p>The great maxim of the Incas was increase of empire, their plea being
the best interest of the tribes they were to conquer. The Inca sent word
that he would come “not to take away their lives or estates, but to
confer upon them all those benefits which the Sun, his father, had
commanded him to perform toward the Indians. He (would come) to do them
good, by teaching them to live according to rules of reason and laws of
nature, and that, leaving their idols, they should henceforward adore
the Sun for their only god, by whose gracious command he had received
them to pardon. To which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_196" id="page_196">{196}</a></span> end, and to no other purpose (for he stood in
no need of their service) he traveled from country to country.”</p>

<p>So well did most of the surrounding tribes realize this, that messages
of submission came before the conquerors had even turned in their
direction. If it happened that because of ignorance they held out
against the benefits an indulgent sovereign was waiting to bestow, the
Inca’s messengers informed them of his exact intentions. All good gifts
would be theirs, provided only they would renounce their independence,
their language and religion, and send their chief god as an hostage of
submission to the Temple of the Sun in Cuzco. Honored servants of the
Inca would come to them in return to acquaint them more in particular
with the new benefits they were about to receive. Skilled workmen would
teach them the arts. The sons of their <i>cacique</i> (chieftain) would be
sent to Cuzco to receive instruction. Moreover, the Inca would confer
upon them the garments worn by his own gracious person.</p>

<p>Nearly all perceived the wisdom of such a course at once. But if in
blindness any still<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_197" id="page_197">{197}</a></span> rebelled, messengers brought word that “the Inca
pitied their folly which had so unnecessarily betrayed them to the last
extremity of want and famine.” For enlightened they were to be, in spite
of themselves.</p>

<p>Wonderful are the tales of these victorious campaigns, for the Inca’s
army never knew defeat. The soldiers were as plentifully supplied from
vast granaries as if in Cuzco. If the march led through lowlands, the
entire army was relieved every two months. Though the Indians of the
mountain-tops did not object to cold, they succumbed to fevers soon
after descending into the comfortable valleys. When a new province had
been incorporated, the gracious Inca “confirmed the right of possession
to the natives of it.”</p>

<p>The empire extended from the Chibchas and Caras of Ecuador, beyond the
Chilean deserts. Only one region dared defiance; that was the primeval
jungle. The armies might skirmish about upon its edges, and exact exotic
tribute of the savages who ventured forth. But within its grim interior
they were secure.</p>

<p>In the provinces of Antis, people “killed one<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_198" id="page_198">{198}</a></span> another as they casually
met,” and worshipped a jaguar, the original lord of the jungle. They
sacrificed hearts and blood of men to huge snakes “thicker than a man’s
thigh.” They made war only to eat the flesh of their enemies. They were
called “nose of iron” because they bored the bridge between the nostrils
to hang in it a jewel or long piece of gold or silver. With a handful of
men, Yupanqui visited these savages below the Andes and imposed worship
of the Sun. With a handful of men, the Spaniards wiped the great
organization of the Empire of the Sun off the face of the earth and
established upon its ruins a Christian civilization.</p>

<p>The people in the Valley of Palta bound tablets upon the head of a
new-born child and tightened them each day for three years, until the
skull was elongated, in order to fit the pointed woolen cap which it was
the fashion to wear.</p>

<p>The Chachapoyas wore a black binder about their heads, stitched with
white flies, and instead of a feather, the tip of a deer’s horn. Their
chief weapons were slings bound about<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_199" id="page_199">{199}</a></span> their heads, and they adored the
condor as their principal god.</p>

<p>The Chancas were the most dangerous opponents of Cuzco, a powerful race
owing their origin to a jaguar, who dressed in skins of their god and
carried effigies of jaguars with a man’s head to their sacrifices of
children, by whose eyes they prognosticated.</p>

<p>The <i>caciques</i> of all dependent tribes were obliged to appear once a
year at court, or if they lived very far away, once in two years. They
brought with them gold and silver from their mines, for all such things
were devoted to worship of the Inca. Failing these, they presented
jaguars, droll monkeys, parrots, wondrous condors, and giant toads and
snakes that were very fierce, kept in dens for the grandeur of the
court. People from all climates presented indigenous gifts, the most
beautiful or the most curious of any creature or plant within their
domains. Any known thing preëminent in any way added the name of its
peculiar excellence to the titles of the Inca. His court in Cuzco
consisted of more than eight thousand persons, nobles who traced descent
from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_200" id="page_200">{200}</a></span> Sun, and representatives of all the fantastic tribes blest by
the Inca’s clemency. Even the greatest lords carried bundles in his
presence.</p>

<p>The noble city of Cuzco, where the children of Inti first stopped with
their wedge of gold, was itself worshipped. Those who lived in Cuzco had
a certain superiority. Divisions of the city were the Terrace of
Flowers, the Lion Picket with the dens of pumas, the Field of Speech,
the Quarter of the Great Serpents, the Scarlet Cantut&mdash;the flower of the
Inca&mdash;the Holy Gate, the Shoulder Blade, the Seaweed Bridge, and so on,
bounded by small streams and long, somber walls of perfectly fitted
stones.</p>

<p>Up above the city hangs the stupendous fortress of Sachsahuaman,
exceeding all the seven wonders of the world, a cyclopean work of the
primitive age. Squier says: “The largest stone in the fortress has a
computed weight of 361 tons.” Sachsahuaman must indeed have been raised
by enchantment in a night like Tiahuanacu, for it surpasses the art of
man, the labyrinth of passageways contracting here and there so that a
single man could keep back an army, subterranean tunnels leading to
temples</p>

<p class="nind">and palaces of the city. From the inmost recesses of the fortress, a
fountain of clear water bubbles. Its mysterious murmur fills the secret
passageways.</p>

<p>Even a single stone destined as a part of the fortress partakes of the
enchantment. According to legend, twenty thousand Indians had dragged it
from a distant quarry, up and down over the wild mountains. Once it
fell, killing “three or four thousand of those Indians who were the
guides to direct and support it.” And when, after its painful journey,
the monster finally beheld the lofty fortress of which it was to form a
part, it fell for the last time, shedding bloody tears from the hollow
orbs of its eyes. It still lies on the same spot, receding deeper and
deeper into the ground whenever attempts are made to remove it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_202" id="page_202">{202}</a></span></p>

<p>“May he not destroy us! He, the creator of the earth; he, the
righteous, who created heaven."&mdash;<i>Hymn of Indian Sun-worship from
the Rig-Veda.</i> </p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Primitive</span> peoples usually adore that natural force which is their
greatest good. Gratitude for benefits conferred is the basis of all
pagan religion. Primitive peoples also worship the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_203" id="page_203">{203}</a></span> sky and the bright
objects within it. Sun worshippers combine the two.</p>

<p>Inti, the Sun, child of the Universal Spirit, is his mighty emblem, a
symbol of his uncreated glory, the quickening principle in nature, the
great wizard of Peru, the only source of vitality upon earth, by whose
energy the winds arise, the glaciers slide over the mountains, by whose
energy even the rain descends, the rivers swell, and cascades leap
through the valleys down toward the sea. In how much more real a sense
than the Incas knew is Peru the land of the sun!</p>

<p>The Sun, ruler of the stars, together with Quilla, the Moon, ruler of
winds and waters, his sister, wife, and queen, created beautiful Chasca,
the Dawn, “whose time was the gloaming and twilight, whose messengers
the fleecy clouds which sail through the sky ... and who, when he shakes
his clustering hair, drops noiselessly pearls of dew on the green grass
fields.”</p>

<p>The light-rays emanating from the Sun and the morning star of double
course are his messengers, bringing strength and power. They precede to
announce his coming in the morn<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_204" id="page_204">{204}</a></span>ing, and follow him as, by the force of
his power and heat, the sea parts in the evening to receive him.</p>

<p>The name of Sun-temples in Peru was Intihuatana, the binding of the Sun,
the place where the eternal light or fire was held fast. Though there
were many such throughout the kingdom, the Holy of Holies was at Cuzco,
the Place of Gold, Inti-cancha, oriented to the sunrise, golden crown
gleaming, sheltering walls and cornices lined with gold plates under its
roof of straw. There flamed the great golden image of the Sun,
glistening with emeralds and other precious stones, completely covering
one side of the temple opposite the eastern portal. The mummies of all
former kings, perfect replicas of themselves, sat staring as in more
active days from their thrones of gold along the walls, the eyes shining
with a mixture of gold. “And so light were these bodies that an Indian
could easily carry one of them in his arms to the houses of Spanish
gentlemen who desired to see them.”</p>

<p>Beyond, twinkled the temple of the Moon, the Sun’s <i>coya</i>. The queens,
her descendants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_205" id="page_205">{205}</a></span> were also called <i>coya</i>, “not being worthy a title so
truly magnificent as Inca.” This was the Place of Silver, surrounded by
the dark shadow of night, receiving the silent homage of the queens, the
sister-wives of the Incas, reposing on silver thrones. At full moon the
festival of the deities of water was held here.</p>

<p>A white cross of crystalline jasper hung from a silver chain in a secret
place. The white light in it increased and decreased with the moon. It
was beneficent and associated with the morning light, whose compartment
came next, sacred to the Dawn with the Morning Star, <i>chasca coyllur</i>,
ragged with earth mist, he of the long curling locks, the page of the
Sun. The royal runners were named for him, messengers of the Inca as he
of the Sun. All the other stars, companions of the Moon, which vanish at
the coming of the Sun, glittered each in its proper magnitude from a
starry ceiling.</p>

<p>The temple belonging to Thunder, Lightning, and the
Thunderbolt&mdash;servants of the Sun, but messengers of an angry god&mdash;shone
with tiles of gold, but was without symbol. As the arms of the Inca, the
dread liquid fire which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_206" id="page_206">{206}</a></span> darted from heaven like a golden serpent with
quick spring and mortal bite, surrounded the Rainbow, beautiful
<i>cuychi</i>, whose image spanned one wall of the room beyond, a
multi-colored ray of the Sun, flickering over the showery hillside,
announcing his gracious reappearance after the tempest and promising
peace. The all-powerful Sun could subdue the dark cloud and draw from
its depths the shining rainbow, whose fragile arch widens as the Sun
sinks. He lives in the clouds, and the rainbow is the hem of his
garment. Is it strange that the Incas should have held it in such
veneration that when they saw it in the air they shut their mouths and
clapped their hands before it? Is it not stranger that they only should
have worshipped the rainbow and placed it on their banners as an emblem
of God?</p>

<p>All the priests of the Sun in Cuzco were of the blood royal, a
privileged class. As many as thirty thousand officiated in Inti-cancha.
They washed the sacrifices in fountains of water which bubbled up in
golden cisterns and celebrated the great festivals in glittering dresses
of feathers with drums of serpents’ skins.</p>

<p>In Acllahuasi, near by, lived a thousand virgins, the most beautiful of
all the pure blood of the Sun, destined as his wives, and watched over
by their <i>mamacunas</i>. Visited only by the <i>coya</i>, they spun the fine
vicuña garments for the Inca’s use and sewed upon them little plates of
gold and emeralds. They wove and embroidered the royal coca bags which
the Inca hung upon his left shoulder. They made the sacred <i>llautu</i> with
the colored fringe, and the straw-colored twist for the head of the
prince royal. They gathered bones of white llamas and burned them with
linen they had spun. Then they collected the ashes, and looking toward
the east, threw them into the air, an offering to the Sun. They made
bread for the festivals of the Sun and the <i>chicha</i> drunk by the Inca
and his kindred, in kettles of gold and silver. For recreation they went
out to walk in their garden of silver and gold.</p>

<p>Nearly half the year in the Empire of the Sun was given to
celebrating&mdash;everything from the first day of the moon to the day of
marriage of the royal brides, <i>coyaraymi</i>. The beginnings of the four
seasons were festivals. At the ver<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_208" id="page_208">{208}</a></span>nal equinox degrees of chivalry were
taken by young nobles who, having gone through all possible tests,
fasting, and temptation, received at last the kiss upon the shoulder and
the jab through the ear-lobe given by the Inca with a nail of gold.</p>

<p>At the autumnal equinox all subjects were cleansed of whatever troubled
them, when, purified with children’s blood, they asked the midday Sun to
protect them from outward calamities and inward diseases. A messenger of
the Sun with a gold-studded lance, fluttering feathers of many colors
along its length, ran down from Sachsahuaman to the center of the city,
where four sons of the Sun waited with lances to be touched by him, and
scatter to the four quarters of the earth at the Sun’s command, all
evils which beset mankind. Each ran six leagues in his separate
direction to spread the good news. People shook their clothes. The evils
of night were driven out by lighted torches, which were then thrown into
a stream and extinguished before being borne away. Confession of sins
followed.</p>

<p>The greatest feast was Intiraymi, the Binding<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_209" id="page_209">{209}</a></span> of the Sun, when his
southern shadow grew no longer, when the Sun-god by some unknown power
was hindered from progressing farther. This was always a mystery. Tupac
Yupanqui had said: “Many say that the Sun lives, and that he is the
maker of all things.... Now we know that many things receive their
beings during the absence of the Sun and therefore he is not the maker
of all things; and that the Sun hath not life is evident for that it
always moves in its circle and yet is never weary, for if it had life it
would require rest as we do and were it free it would visit other parts
of the heavens unto which it never inclines out of its own sphere. But
as a thing obliged to a particular station, moves always in the same
circle and is like an arrow which is directed by the hand of the
archer.”</p>

<p>Later, Huayna Ccapac said: “There must be some other whom our father,
the Sun, takes for a more supreme and more powerful lord than himself;
by whose commands he every day measures the compass of the heavens
without any intermission or hour of repose; for if he were absolute and
at his own disposal he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_210" id="page_210">{210}</a></span> certainly allot himself some time of
cessation though it were only to please his own humor and fancy without
other consideration than that of liberty and change.”</p>

<p>But to continue with the festival of the summer solstice. At peep of day
the Inca and all the nobles of the blood of the Sun went in procession
under canopies of feathers to await his arrival. Foreign princes and
distinguished vassals, in garments plated with gold and silver, skins of
jaguars, and condors’ wings, assembled at a little distance, the whole
people filling the streets of Cuzco. All barefoot, crouching, they
waited, looking toward the east. Hardly had the first rays touched the
snowy mountain-tops when a loud shout of joy, songs of triumph, and
deafening music on rude instruments broke from the multitude. It grew
louder and louder as the god, in rising, shed more and more light upon
the people. They raised their arms, opened their hands, and kissed the
air so filled with light.</p>

<p>The Inca, rising, greeted the pomp of dawn. He held two great bowls of
gold filled with <i>chicha</i> in his hands; the contents of one he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_211" id="page_211">{211}</a></span> poured
into a golden channel leading to the temple, and the vapor rising in the
heat, it seemed as if the Sun himself were drinking. The contents of the
other he shared with all his kindred, pouring it into little golden
goblets.</p>

<p>Then they all proceeded to the temple. Outside, the <i>curacas</i>, or
governors, offered to the priests images of many different animals of
gold, while the Inca and all the legitimate children of the Sun went in
and presented the goblets he had consecrated to the image of the Sun.
There were sacrifices of flocks of black llamas, the particular property
of the Sun, from which prognostications were made. The animal to be
sacrificed was held fast, and with a sliver of black obsidian its breast
was opened and the heart torn out. Sometimes as many as two hundred
thousand llamas were sacrificed during a year.</p>

<p>It is a horrid chapter from the Incas’ story that they made human
sacrifices along with everything else which they valued. Von Tschudi
says that they offered to the Sun as many as two hundred children at one
time. “The children were strangled and buried with the silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_212" id="page_212">{212}</a></span> figures
of sheep, having first walked around the statues of the Creator, the
Sun, the Thunder, and the Moon. Sometimes they were crushed between two
stones, sometimes their mouths were stuffed with ground coca.”</p>

<p>The fire for sacrifice was a direct gift of the Sun, kindled from a
great polished bracelet upon the left arm of the high priest. The
Virgins of the Sun bore away some of it to care for during the following
year. No more unhappy omen could occur than its extinction.</p>

<p>The Inca sat within view of all, mounted upon his gold seat, drinking to
his kindred and to the <i>curacas</i> in order. The cups his lips had touched
were kept as idols.</p>

<p>The Sun had drunk of their offerings; he had kindled their sacrificial
fire; he now entertained his subjects with a banquet prepared by the
hands of his own Virgin-wives. As three days of universal fasting had
preceded the feast of the Sun, so for nine days reveling followed. They
ate the bread of the Sun Virgins, and drank their <i>chicha</i>, they shouted
and danced and masqueraded, each tribe of the empire with differing
head-dresses of feathers and grotesque</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VIb" id="CHAPTER_VIb"></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><br />
INDIANS AND LLAMAS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Had</span> the Indians of the sixteenth century not known that their overthrow
was the will of Pachacamac, the miracles constantly favoring the
Spaniards would have forced them to recognize the fact. Pious
chroniclers tell of Saint James on a white horse, who came with
glistening sword to turn the tide of battle, and of the Virgin Mary,
whose appearance in the clouds blinded the hostile Indians.</p>

<p>The Incas could but succumb to the sovereign will. Some retreated beyond
the mountains, leaving indelible traces upon the people of the jungle.
Some were thrown into fortresses, which “their ancestors had built for
ostentation of their glory.” On the authority of Garcilasso, thirty-six
males of the blood of the Sun, who had been condemned to live in Lima,
the Spanish City of the Kings, had in three years’ time all died. Sayri
Tupac, a nephew of Ata<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_215" id="page_215">{215}</a></span>hualpa, had come to Lima for the privilege of
renouncing his sovereignty. The <i>amautas</i> had consulted the flight of
birds as to whether he should surrender himself to the Spaniards, but as
Garcilasso says: “They made no inquiries of the devil because all the
oracles of that country became dumb so soon as the sacraments of our
holy mother, the church of Rome, entered into those dominions.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Sayri Tupac, as he lifted the gold fringe of the table-cloth,
“all this cloth and its fringe were mine, and now they give me a thread
of it for my sustenance and that of all my house.” He was allowed to
withdraw to the beautiful valley of Yucay, “rather to enjoy the air and
delights of the pleasant garden formerly belonging to his ancestors than
in regard to any claim or propriety he had therein.” But he sank into a
deep melancholy and died within two years.</p>

<p>The Spaniards were occupied with duels and assassinations of friends,
bloody civil wars and religious disputes, usually about the Immaculate
Conception. One can read volumes of such proceedings. Indian revolts
were a constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_216" id="page_216">{216}</a></span> interruption. The Spaniards gradually discovered that
it was impossible to keep the Indians quiet while an Inca remained
alive; so in 1571, less than forty years after their arrival, Tupac
Amaru, the last of the Incas, was put to death by the Spaniards in the
following manner, as described by Garcilasso de la Vega in the words of
his first English translation (1688).</p>

<p>“His crimes were published by the common crier, namely, that he intended
to rebel, that he had drawn into the plot with him several Indians who
were his creatures, ... designing thereby to deprive and dispossess his
Catholic majesty, King Philip the Second, who was emperor of the new
world, of his crown and dignity within the kingdom of Peru. This
sentence to have his head cut off was signified to the poor Inca without
telling him the reasons or causes of it, to which he innocently made
answer that he knew no fault he was guilty of which could merit death,
but in case the vice-king had any jealousy of him or his people he might
easily secure himself from those fears by sending him under a secure
guard into Spain, where he should be very glad to kiss the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_217" id="page_217">{217}</a></span> of Don
Philip, his lord and master. He farther argued that ... if his father
with two hundred thousand soldiers could not overcome two hundred
Spaniards whom they had besieged within the city of Cuzco, how then
could it be imagined that he could think to rebel with the small number
against such multitudes of Christians who were now disbursed over all
parts of the Empire.” How little effect the words of Tupac Amaru
produced upon the Spaniards can be judged by the following:</p>

<p>“Accordingly the poor Prince was brought out of the prison and mounted
on a mule with his hands tied and a halter about his neck with a crier
before him declaring that he was a rebel and a traitor against the crown
of his Catholic majesty. The Prince not understanding the Spanish
language asked of one of the friars who went with him what it was that
the crier said, and when it was told him that he proclaimed him a
traitor against the king, his lord, he caused the crier to be called to
him and desired him to forbear to publish such horrible lies, which he
knew to be so, for that he never committed any act of treason nor ever
had it in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_218" id="page_218">{218}</a></span> imaginations, as the world very well knew. ‘But,’ said
he, ‘tell them that they kill me without other cause, that only the
vice-king will have it so, and I call God the Pachacamac of all to
witness that what I say is nothing but the truth.’ After which the
officers of justice proceeded to the place of execution.... The crowds
cried out with loud exclamation accompanied with a flood of tears,
saying, ‘Wherefore, Inca, do they carry thee to have thy head cut
off?... Desire the executioner to put us to death together with thee who
are thine by blood and nature and should be much more contented and
happy to accompany thee into the other world than to live here slaves
and servants to thy murderers.’</p>

<p>“The noise and outcry was so great that it was feared lest some
insurrection and outrage should ensue amongst such a multitude of people
gathered together, which could not be counted for less than three
hundred thousand souls. This combustion caused the officers to hasten
their way unto the scaffold, where being come the Prince walked up the
stairs with the friars who assisted at his death and followed by the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_219" id="page_219">{219}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">executioner with his broad sword drawn in his hand. And now the Indians
feeling their Prince just upon the brink of death lamented with such
groans and outcries as rent the air.... Wherefore the priests who were
discoursing with the Prince desired him that he would command the people
to be silent, whereupon the Inca, lifting up his right hand with the
palm of his hand open, pointed it towards the place whence the noise
came and then lowered it by little and little until it came to rest upon
his right thigh, which, when the Indians observed, their murmur calmed
and so great a silence ensued as if there had not been one soul alive
within the whole city. The Spaniards and the vice-king who were then at
a window ... wondered much to see the obedience which the Indians in all
their passion showed to their dying Inca, who received the stroke of
death with that undaunted courage as the Incas and the Indian nobles did
usually show when they fell into the hands of their enemy and were
cruelly treated and unhumanly butchered.”</p>

<p>When they first stepped upon the shores of Peru, a Spaniard or two could
travel hundreds<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_220" id="page_220">{220}</a></span> of leagues alone through this foreign country on the
shoulders of men and be adored as gods in passing. Before long, an army
was not secure. A Spanish governor and his escort of thirty men were
resting one day upon a high plain. The Indians, whistling to each other
with bird calls and barking like wolves in the night, “went softly to
the Spaniards’ tents, where, finding them asleep, they cut the throats
of every one of them.”</p>

<p>Such deeds were being done in the Empire of the Lover of the Poor, the
Deliverer of the Distressed, where formerly each individual had been
forbidden to injure even himself.</p>

<p>The spirit of rebellion spread among the Indians. They tried to poison
the water-supply of the City of the Kings. They tried to burn Cuzco,
imagining they could burn the Spaniards with it. Their revolts
culminated in that great rebellion of 1780 under José Gabriel
Condorcanqui, called Tupac Amaru, whose descendant, through a daughter,
he was. His followers swore their hatred of the white race and vowed not
to leave a white dog, not even a white fowl alive. They even scraped the
whitewash from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_221" id="page_221">{221}</a></span> the walls of their houses. They did succeed in
strangling a governor. In return, Tupac Amaru’s tongue was cut out, and
after seeing his wife, son, and brother tortured to death before his
eyes, was himself sentenced to be torn apart by wild horses.</p>

<p>The men were slaughtered in such numbers that the women went out to help
each other sow the fields. At sunset they returned, hand in hand,
singing a melancholy lament, until this too was prohibited by Spanish
law. All musical instruments were to be destroyed; the use of the
Quichua language was forbidden; women were ordered not to spin as they
walked; distinctive customs were to be laid aside. All lapsed into
spiritless dullness. The air of desolation spread.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>The Indians of Peru are a silent people trained by cold and cutting
winds. They bite the end of their <i>ponchos</i> to show anger and live to an
immense age. Their thoughts turn backwards. They grind their teeth on
the same hard corn kernels as formerly and drink the same corn-brandy;
they carry about as talismans little<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_222" id="page_222">{222}</a></span> effigies of llamas found in the
graves of their ancestors and throw their criminals over the same lofty
precipices. The juice of the red thorn-apple leads them into ecstasy,
the only high light of their existence, for by means of it they
communicate with the spirits of their ancestors. The only passion they
have brought with them through the centuries is remembrance of the past.
The thorn-apple is called <i>huaca cachu</i>, the plant of the grave.</p>

<p>The Indians squat about in groups with their little gourds of <i>chicha</i>.
There is no laughing. The mummy-like babies do not cry. The lake on
whose banks they live contains no fish. No worm, no insect, inhabits its
banks. But there is a spirit which broods from the mountain above. He
will lighten the burden of the traveler who seeks the mountain-top and
presents him offerings in the depths of night. The <i>achachibas</i> or piles
of stones are witness to his gracious power.</p>

<p>Between two mountain-tops lies a steel-colored lake shimmering in its
stone basin. The Indians come here to beg for fire-water. They pour in
brandy, standing on a peak while ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_223" id="page_223">{223}</a></span>king their libation to the rain-god,
and then leave without a word. Immediately the rain pours.</p>

<p>Only their religious festivals recall Inca feast days. Christianity has
never been able to abolish the bacchanales of former times; it has
merely changed their names. The call of triumph, <i>haylli</i>, has been
changed to Hallelujah, Christian anthems are set to Indian tunes, IHS
has been engraved on the stone doorways of antiquity. Over the shrines
outside the churches are effigies of sun and moon. Above the megalithic
fortress of Sachsahuaman three crosses preside where the banners once
indicated the dwelling of the Children of the Sun. Indians still salute
the Sun temple on first entering Cuzco, though the nave of the Dominican
church stands upon the spot where the Sun was worshipped in golden
chambers, its Christian walls built of mammoth stones rolled together
for the glory of the Sun. This superstructure typifies the methods of
the missionary priests.</p>

<p>A wooden llama filled with fire-crackers is exploded on Good Friday. By
the roadside, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_224" id="page_224">{224}</a></span> Indian in a grotesque mask, with a feather crown and
bells on his arms and legs, leaps in fantastic bounds to celebrate the
day of the Holy Cross. A picture of the Virgin is carried about on her
Ascension Day. The Indians, dressed in the masks of wild animals and
multi-colored feathers with bits of savage embroidery on their loose
garments, dance about her to fifes and drum-beats and rattles of beans
and snail-shells. Wild dances, horn-blowing, ugly voices screaming, and
rattling tin&mdash;these heathen orgies swarm at the feet of effigies of
Christ.</p>

<p>The Indian has to be content with the scanty earnings he can get from
the transport of heavy burdens and from the wool of his llamas. By
chewing coca he is able to run all day before the rider. His world is
the valley where he lives. His occupation does not lead him to the
mountain-top above, nor does his thought soar as far. His gloom sulks in
his dress and manner of life, even in his songs and dances. When he
reaches his little smoky hut, he eats his frozen and pressed potato,
plays a wee tune on his <i>quena</i> and goes to sleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_225" id="page_225">{225}</a></span></p>

<p>Self-sufficient because in need of nothing, the llama is the
interpretation of the Indian. Both are products of the soil, like the
<i>yareta</i> moss and the birds which swim in the icy water.</p>

<p>The dark-eyed llamas, with red-woolen tassels in their ears, move slowly
across the icy plateau.</p>

<p>Could anything equal the dignity of a llama, his serenity, his hauteur?
Why not? He knows he is indispensable. There is no one to take his
place. His wool furnishes clothing, his skin leather, his flesh food,
his dung fuel, and he is a beast of burden where no other can live on
the bare, breathless heights.</p>

<p>In return, he asks no shelter, warm beneath his shaggy coat. He asks no
food, for he grazes on the stiff <i>ychu</i> grass as he journeys along. He
needs no shoes, no harness, and even provides, himself, the wool for the
homespun bags lying upon his back. When there is no water, he carries in
bags made of his own skin what is necessary for man. Nor do his
benefactions end here. The llama furnished the mystery-loving Spaniards
with that strange bezoar stone which, on account of its miraculous
endowments, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_226" id="page_226">{226}</a></span> placed in the list with emeralds, pearls, turquoises,
and other precious stones from Peru.</p>

<p>Is it astonishing that the llama makes his own rules of conduct and
exacts entire consideration of them? Disobedience he indicates in a way
not to be forgotten! And yet such is his docility that dozens are often
kept within bounds by a single thread stretched around them breast
high,&mdash;rugged little mountain beasts herded with worsted! Usually so
gentle, if a llama is annoyed he becomes revengeful and useless. He
never will hurry, for supplying his own food he must graze when
opportunity offers. He will not be overloaded. One hundred pounds he
will cheerfully carry, but with more than that he sits down like a
camel, dreamily chewing his cud, and can be neither forced nor persuaded
to rise. In speaking of the alpaca, cousin of the llama, Father Acosta
said that “the only remedy is to stay and sit down by the <i>paco</i>, making
much on him, until the fit be passed, and that he rise; and sometimes
they are forced to stay two or three hours.”</p>

<p>The little variegated herd, with expressions of mild surprise, step
daintily along as if walking</p>

<p class="nind">on eggs, following at even distances, each moving with authority of a
whole procession. If frightened, they huddle into a compact group,
craning their long necks toward the center. Then they look you wistfully
in the face for minutes at a time without moving. The halter of the
leader is embroidered, and small streamers flutter from it. Most of the
llamas have tassels in their ears, or little pendants or bells. Thus
they file across the snow-covered cordillera.</p>

<p>At night when they sink on to the <i>puna</i> at their journey’s end, a faint
murmur like many æolian harps is wafted into the perfect stillness of
the frosty night. It is the llamas’ appreciation of rest.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_Ic" id="CHAPTER_Ic"></a>CHAPTER I<br /><br />
A LAND OF ADVENTURE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> a “hereditary spell” the jungle has had upon men! How smilingly its
beauty allures&mdash;and how graciously it repels! Yet its beauty is not
merely beauty. It flashes suggestions of wondrous lands beyond, bringing
to the imagination a pleasure in its own vision like the joy of nature
in her own loveliness. The jungle is a region which men have always
peopled with strange forms pleasing to their fancies, yet a region of
dread, beyond human loneliness. It has sheltered in turn the desideratum
of each age, while surrounding it with fearful mysteries. But though men
have looked upon the jungle with awe, magic possibilities were still
within and beyond. <i>A chacun son infini.</i></p>

<p>Both Inca Rocca and Yupanqui attempted to conquer the jungle. Between
Paucartampu and the Madre de Díos are vestiges of an Inca road.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_232" id="page_232">{232}</a></span> But
downpours and floods made roads give way to watercourses. The Incas
called them “doorways” to the woods, which mountain rapids had opened by
irresistible force; but no one could pass through. Even the executive
Incas were obliged to turn back with only a fringe of jungle conquest,
great campaigns resulting only in loss of life then as now. They
retreated, submissive before nature’s impregnable stronghold. There are
tribes of strange, shy little people still showing traces of contact
with the Incas. Although so long ago, they made a profounder impression
than all subsequent invaders. Even if the conquered savages remained in
the jungle after submitting to the Incas, they were obliged to pay
tribute to them, observing the habits of their conquerors when they
emerged. Those Incas, also, who withdrew into the woods to escape
Spanish persecution, carried their customs with them. No matter how
their influence was perpetuated, tribes still show the “footprints of
Incas” in the surface of rocks, and even as far as the Mishagua are
found legends of Incas’ hidden treasure. With them in mind, the “big
ears<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_233" id="page_233">{233}</a></span>” of some of the savages assume a strange significance.</p>

<p>Where the Madera and the Amazon meet there is a great island, a river
island hundreds of miles in extent. Its name is Tumpinambaranas, and
upon it are remains of gigantic buildings. Was this the fabulous
country, Paytiti of mystery, powerful in riches, a legendary home of
Manco Ccapac? Georg M. von Hassel is now investigating this hazy
subject. The people of Tumpinambaranas had legends of a race, the
Mutayces, who lived toward the south, “whose feet grew backwards so that
any one who attempted to follow them by their track, would, if he were
ignorant of this malformation, go farther from them.”</p>

<p>Columbus breathed the sweet air which blew across from the forests near
the mouth of the Orinoco and faithfully imagined it one of the four
great rivers flowing from paradise. Had he only dared, he said, he would
have liked to push forward to where he might hope to find the celestial
boundaries of the world, and a little farther, to have bathed his eyes
with profound humility in the light of the flaming swords<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_234" id="page_234">{234}</a></span> which were
wielded by two seraphim before the gate of Eden.</p>

<p>The cavaliers in search of gold believed that El Dorado lived within the
mysterious jungle. Their expeditions were imbued with awe. Adolph F.
Bandelier has transcribed the source of the legend. It is the ceremonial
of choosing the <i>uzaque</i> of Guatavitá:</p>

<p>“In front walked wailing men, nude, their bodies painted with red ochre,
the sign of deep mourning.... Groups followed of men richly decorated
with gold and emeralds, their heads adorned with feathers, and braves
clothed in jaguars’ skins. The greater number of them went uttering
joyful shouts, others blew on horns, pipes and conchs.... The rear of
the procession was composed of the nobles and the chief priests, bearing
the newly elected chieftain upon a barrow hung with discs of gold. His
naked body was anointed with resinous gums and covered all over with
gold dust. This was the gilded man, <i>el hombre dorado</i>, whose fame had
reached the sea coast. Arrived at the shore, the gilded chief and his
companions stepped upon a <i>balsa</i> and proceeded upon it to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_235" id="page_235">{235}</a></span> middle
of the lake. There the chief plunged into the water and washed off his
metallic covering, while the assembled company, with shouts and the
sound of instruments, threw in the gold and the jewels they had brought
with them.”</p>

<p>Treasures have been found in this lake, among others a group of golden
figures. The chronicler Don Rafael Zerda says: “Undoubtedly this piece
represents the ... <i>cacique</i> of Guatavitá surrounded by Indian priests
on the raft, which was taken on the day of the ceremony to the middle of
the lake” for sacrifice to its goddess.</p>

<p>“Humboldt saw the staircase down which the gilded man and his train in
jaguars’ skins descended to the waters of the lake of Guatavitá. He also
found the remains of the tunnels by which the Spaniards had tried to
drain the lake.”</p>

<p>A joint stock company in 1903 did drain the lake of Guatavitá. But its
mud turned to cement before they could dig in it.</p>

<p>The “vision of the Dorado appeared like a mirage, enticing, deceiving,
leading men to destruction.” It became the name of a mythical<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_236" id="page_236">{236}</a></span> country,
where rivers ran over sands of gold, and palaces stood on golden pillars
shining with emeralds. Infamous adventurers, brave as the knights of the
Round Table, confronted and stormed the great jungle.</p>

<p>Orellana and Gonzalo Pizarro tried to find the glittering capital of
Manoa, which El Dorado had gradually become. For these buccaneers who
set out with an arrogant army to conquer the Cinnamon Country, nature
became the supreme fact of existence. Famine, perpetual rain, fevers,
strange insects, and reptiles attacked them. Their expeditions could but
end in the murder of each other. They followed the example of all life
in the jungle.</p>

<p>Doctor Middendorf says that the Amazon was named for the Coniapuyara, a
race of big women leaders, whom the Spaniards found. Condamine assures
us that light-skinned Amazons lived there. Raleigh, while searching for
Manoa, is said to have first reported them, though he found them by
going up the Orinoco. The distinguished scientist Ulloa, who went to
South America in 1758, says it is “an undoubted truth that there had
been formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_237" id="page_237">{237}</a></span> several communities of women who formed a kind of
republic, without admitting any men into the government.” Well, at least
there is nothing either to prove or disprove it. A recent report of the
Geographical Society of Lima gives a far less picturesque explanation of
the naming of the Amazon, to the effect that “the tribe of the Nahumedes
were thought to be Amazons on account of their long hair and the
<i>cushma</i>, a long, sleeveless garment which they wore.”</p>

<p>Close upon the adventurers came the Jesuit missionaries, who burned to
save from hell-fire the strange human beings they might find lurking in
the forest depths. One Jesuit father, Fritz, spent fifty years
(1680-1730) on the Amazon, trying to connect the aborigines by the
introduction of a common language. These missionaries left no ruins like
those in Paraguay, the Jesuit State, but their teachings are visible in
savage traditions. They transformed Bible stories to fit jungle needs.</p>

<p>“A Murato was fishing in a lake of Pastasa, when a little lizard
swallowed his hook. The fisherman killed it, the mother of the lizards
was much angered and with her tail slashed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_238" id="page_238">{238}</a></span> water in such a way that
it overflowed the entire vicinity. All were drowned except one, who
climbed into a small <i>pivai</i> palm, and hung there several days under a
perpetual darkness. From time to time a fruit of the <i>pivai</i> palm fell,
but always upon the water, until one day he heard the plump of the fruit
upon dry ground. He got down from the tree, made a house and farm, and
with a little piece of his flesh, which he planted in the earth, made
for himself a wife, by whom he had many children.”</p>

<p>The commercial age is now having its fling. It is attempting to subdue
the jungle. The rubber hunters are not seeking paradise. They are not
looking for legendary kingdoms, nor are they wishing to save the souls
of beings of whose existence they are not even persuaded. Rubber is a
valuable product. So are other things concealed in jungle depths. Dark
crimes can also be hidden in the half-light, covered close under the
thick veil which shrouds the land of mystery.</p>

<p>This Peru, approachable from the Atlantic, the “monstrous thicke wood”
of the early travelers, still remains undisturbed. Illimitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_239" id="page_239">{239}</a></span> it is as
you gaze down upon it, stretching away one unbroken forest to the faint
blue horizon, without a single natural approach except the waterways.
Lying close below the austere mountain-tops is a luxuriant world of
vegetation; wide stretches of unpreëmpted soil, sparseness
characteristic of polar regions hangs just above a tropical
phantasmagoria of growth. Shifting cloud-shadows and wandering rainbows
flit and interchange over the jungle like the play of colors on a
peacock’s neck.</p>

<p>Though we know that there are no mighty civilizations of human making,
there are no streets of gold with ruby walls, yet within the
imperturbable recesses are strange races and wonders of plant and animal
life which may interpret whole domains of knowledge. Nature’s secrets
are still locked up in this prolific laboratory. Though we know that no
great race of kings holds sway, yet it is certain that here is a chance
to study in the wild tribes the growth of human language&mdash;beginning with
the poor Inje-inje, who has not more than a bird’s speech, and whose
needs are no greater than his speech would suggest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_240" id="page_240">{240}</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IIc" id="CHAPTER_IIc"></a>CHAPTER II<br /><br />
TOWARD THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the mountain-tops the stream leads toward the east over the
Eyebrows of the Jungle, La Ceja de la Montaña, letting loose a deluge
from its black clouds. Caught between walls of red and black striped
rock, the valley grows deeper and hotter and filled with mist. The water
accumulates brightly colored pebbles. It rolls over ungathered bits of
gold in its sand and rushes them along with slivers of glistening mica.
All about is the sound of springs “whose waters moss has turned aside.”
Buried in luxuriant vegetation, it slides on beneath thickets of guava,
golden cassia, and red-leaved <i>tilandsia</i> bushes, hung with rank passion
vines, whose ripened fruit, the crackly <i>granadilla</i>, lies everywhere
upon the ground. A mammoth iguana, munching the flesh-colored bignonias,
falls occasionally from the tree-tops.</p>

<p>Small, richly plumed parrots nest in the rock<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_241" id="page_241">{241}</a></span> walls. A whole book might
be written about the parrots, various as vegetation itself, flashing
multi-colored light as they scream through the air-spaces. There is the
toucan, turning his bill with its accessory head around to gloss his
splendid plumage in a ray of sunlight. At the other end of the scale are
the meek little green parroquets with perpendicular bills, hardly larger
than sparrows, which go in pairs and move in parallel lines. Every
variety keeps together, each to its kind.</p>

<p>There are other large, fruit-eating birds; birds with curiously shaped
tail feathers; birds with crests and ornamental plumage. As variegated
as their forms are their curious cries. The black ox-bird bellows like a
bull, the black and red <i>tunqui</i> grunts like a pig, and wood-pigeons cry
like children. Occasionally “jets of brilliant melody” sparkle among the
trees, but more often the notes have a mysterious, aerial quality “like
the tinkling of a far-off bell suspended in the air.”</p>

<p>Here hangs the wonderful nest, four feet long, of the pouched starling,
bound together with spiders’ webs as strong as silk. Such is jungle<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_242" id="page_242">{242}</a></span>
lavishness that plants and animals are given endowments useless to them
in their struggle for existence. The bird which builds such a palatial
nest has no advantage over any other. Its wondrous, unplantlike power
gives to the sensitive plant no superiority. Struck with paralysis, it
can recoil at a touch, but that forms no link with its fellow plants.
Such a feat is not an attribute nor in any way a necessity of vegetable
life. It can hardly compensate the sensitive plant for its lack of
perfume and bright flower, the right of every growing thing.</p>

<p>Chatter of monkeys mingles with roar of falling water, hairy manikins,
shrieking and gamboling, “very gentle and delightful apes,” Father
Acosta called them. Tiny, blear-eyed monkeys scream in disapproval of
all they can see, hear, or smell. Scarlet-faced monkeys, owl-faced
monkeys, swing from branch to branch with crazy gestures, “taking one
turn of the tail at least around anything in passing, just
provisionally.”</p>

<p>Thick masses of <i>quinar</i> trees are draped in luxuriant parasites, and
<i>agave</i> bushes are filled with red flowers. The wonderful <i>maguey</i>
grows</p>

<p class="nind">here, yielding water, oil, and vinegar, honey, thread, needles, and
soap. Its juice boiled in rain-water takes away weariness.</p>

<p>Clear water drips over blocks of granite, covering the stone with moss
in falling. The terrible jaguar lies curled up asleep in some far-off
notch, gently purring. Ferns and palms, forerunners of the great empire
of vegetation below, cluster along the brooks swelled with snow. “Tall
and whispering crowds of tree ferns” droop their filmy fronds from
lofty, slender stems. Ferns of every conceivable size and texture
smother rocks and decaying trees. Some are as small as mosses, others
appear monstrous, like those of a moonlight night. Humming-birds flit
above the pomegranates or lose themselves in a banana blossom. “The
rose-colored plumage of the silky cuckoo peeps out like a flower from
the thick foliage.”</p>

<p>It is an earthly paradise, where bloodsucking bats emerge at night and
lightning rages uncontrolled, destroying trees and cracking open
precipices. Pumas live in these clefts hewn through the mountains, and
they spring on to the shoulders of a victim, drawing back the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_244" id="page_244">{244}</a></span> head
until the neck snaps. <i>Pumayacu</i> is the stream of the puma, with its
tumultuous torrent whose very stones are treacherous.</p>

<p>Such are the rain-soaked slopes of the Andes, a tangled mass of jungle.
The woods are all enchanted. Thousands of fairies dance in the sunbeams,
and during the rain myriads of them hide in the flowers. If disturbed,
they disappear underground. One can never be sure that “what one surveys
is what it purports to be, nor even, that in surveying nothing, one is
not gazing through an invisible being,” as Guenelette observed so long
ago.</p>

<p>The half-Indian guide began to speak, taking a coca-leaf from his
fawn-skin pouch.</p>

<p>“Pigmies live in the undergrowth. They are not more than so tall, ...
and very, very wild. No, they’re not monkeys. They have a language,
although we cannot understand it. How do I know they live here? Why! I
know! Have I ever seen them? No. But&mdash;I’ve seen their shadows.</p>

<p>“And then there are jaguars near here, jaguars with the hoofs of
bullocks. At night I can hear them springing upon the thatch of my thin<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_245" id="page_245">{245}</a></span>
roof. They roar and roar and one might call them the devil himself if
one did not know that they were jaguars with the feet of bullocks. Have
I ever seen them?... No, but then&mdash;I’ve seen the prints of their hoofs.</p>

<p>“Here in the bottom of the river, lying full length, lives the great
Mother of Waters. She is so long that she could stretch from bank to
bank and lie sleeping on either side at the same time. That is why she
lies lengthwise in the river bed. Sometimes there is an awful, rumbling
noise, like an approaching earthquake. Then the waters of the river are
churned like the smallest mountain torrent tumbling over a rock in
mid-stream. The great snake lifts her head, then her heavy body from the
stream bed, and crashes off through the jungle. The track she leaves
behind her is a desert waste; no growing thing is left, and the wake is
as broad, why, as broad as this stream, under which she is now lying,”
and he pointed with wide eyes to the water, rushing headlong to join the
Amazon.</p>

<p>All the snakes of that particular locality did miracles, so I was told
by a wise man who could himself turn men into beasts at will.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_246" id="page_246">{246}</a></span></p>

<p>“This river,” the guide concluded, “used to flow up on one side and down
on the other, until white men sailed upon it. Then one half turned
about, and the river now flows in but one direction, as you can see.”</p>

<p>As the gloomy, bottomless ravines descend, the forest becomes more
dense, with murmurs of flowing water everywhere. Mists hang from above,
barely concealing the jagged, black peaks. Sheets of continuous foam
veil the side of a polished cliff. Water drips over every precipice.
Cascades tumble from one mossed basin to another or let fall a clear
column into a rock-pool deeply buried in tropical vegetation.</p>

<p>Finally mountains and ravines subside, and with the energy of one final,
mighty leap, the rushing water plunges into the heart of the jungle,
comes to rest, then glides out with the flush of a flood-tide across the
Land of Water.</p>

<p>“As the serpents of this basin exceed all other serpents in size, so
does the Amazon exceed all other rivers.” As the whirl of branches is to
the trunk of a tree, as everything in nature is tributary to something
else, so are streamlets<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_247" id="page_247">{247}</a></span> in the mountains of the snowy desert to this
mighty river. Collecting itself upon the frozen <i>puna</i> far up among the
clouds, it gets an impetus which makes fresh, wide stretches of ocean
thousands of miles away.</p>

<p>So vast is the Amazon that, like the Andes which form a barrier to
separate two worlds, different species of animals inhabit its opposite
banks. It swarms with fish that will fight for a right to live, and some
of them, the <i>paichi</i>, for instance, reach the length of ten feet and
must be caught by harpooning. The water is full of swimming animals.
There are river-cows like sea-lions, and oceanic fauna such as frigate
birds and flying-fish. In the mud along the banks are tracks of
crocodiles and tortoises.</p>

<p>The Amazon has gained mastery over the land and has turned it into a
sposhy ocean, interspersed with flats of jungle flowers. A watery
labyrinth, “an aquatic not a terrestrial basin,” it is the Mediterranean
of South America. The greatest river in the world twists and turns
about, makes short cuts across its own bends and leaves behind a
delicious lagoon here, or a little, land-locked inlet there. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_248" id="page_248">{248}</a></span>
Victoria Regia spreads its great, leathery leaves, and scarlet ibises
tilt about upon them.</p>

<p>This land beyond the Andes is known as the “rain-shadow.” The already
overflowing rivers are constantly swelling, since it rains so violently
that a stream of the Amazon valley can rise fifteen feet in a single
night. A passing and re-passing is continually going on, for, as the
water flows back toward the ocean, the winds above it are returning from
the Atlantic, bringing rain to moisten the jungle and to be stopped only
by the wall of the Andes.</p>

<p>Rain discloses the resources of the jungle. Plants push, burst upward in
astonishing growth. Flowers paint themselves with ineffable new colors
distilled from the rain, and those whose day has come and gone lie in
heaps of yellow, pink, and white petals on the ground, fallen from
beyond the tree-tops.</p>

<p>A single, heavy tapir, <i>anta</i>, the somber-colored wood-cow, roused by
the rain and encouraged by the added gloom, wanders forth to tear off
new sprouts within its reach. Peccaries rustle by in little droves&mdash;wild
pigs which, it is said, will bite around a tree if their<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_249" id="page_249">{249}</a></span> object of
attack has climbed beyond reach. The minute, silky marmoset, filled with
perennial terror and shivering at the rain, has crept into shelter, and
just daring to show its wrinkled little face, howls dismally.</p>

<p>It is after a rain, too, when the wondrous notes of the <i>organista</i>, the
sweet flute-bird, drip through the trees, mellow, melancholy, yet with a
musical accuracy of pitch as clear-cut as the circle of a drop of water
fallen on a slab of alabaster. These notes share the mystery of the vast
silence itself. Even savages rest on their paddles to listen. Would you
capture the magician and carry the jungle-silence home? You can take the
little gray bird&mdash;but it always dies in captivity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_250" id="page_250">{250}</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IIIc" id="CHAPTER_IIIc"></a>CHAPTER III<br /><br />
JUNGLE GLOOM AND JUNGLE SHEEN</h3>

<h4>I</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the earth was first moistened by rain, and plants first grew, no
limit has been set to the rights of vegetation in the jungle. Its sway
is uncontested. It has known no master. Its insatiable desire to reach
up and out and down has been uncurbed and undirected. And heaven seems
to wish it well. Intensest heat, light, and moisture are showered upon
it. Under such conditions, life would spring spontaneously into being,
were there not myriads of progenitors to be responsible for whatever
form it chose to take.</p>

<p>All the creative force of nature is behind the infinitely varying forms,
and the frightful luxuriance of reproduction. Vegetation has the
extravagance of first geologic ages, bursting with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_251" id="page_251">{251}</a></span> life, rejoicing in
weird, vegetable arabesques and green out-thrusts of leaves.</p>

<p>Amazing trees yield coloring matter of yellow, red, and blue. Trees cure
bites of snakes, the malignant <i>manzanillo</i> infects any one who sleeps
beneath it. Then there is the cow-tree of milky sap, the red-wooded
blood tree, and those furnishing food for curious animals, which
transform it into curious shapes. Beneath the iron-wood, whose sharp
edges are hard as steel, crawls the sensitive plant. There are whole
forests of <i>cinchona</i>, whose beautiful flowers are forgotten because of
the value of the bark. The dead man’s tree grows here, whose stems are
sucked by witch-doctors to produce a trance; also the wonderful tree of
rain, which Boussingault referred to when he said: “By the light of the
moon we could distinctly see drops of water dripping from the branches.”
The drier the night the more water it condenses, letting it fall upon
the ground beneath. Ponderous leafage overarches great trunks, columns
of a giant’s castle, each with its peculiar color. While some are
smooth, others are deeply fissured or armed with long spikes. Most of
the tree-trunks are<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_252" id="page_252">{252}</a></span> indistinguishable for the mass of vines
“sculptured” upon them. They cleave to the smooth bark, darting out
roots as they ascend. “The green eaves of foliage seem supported by
pillars of leaves.”</p>

<p>Tapering ribbons sway to and fro, tangling themselves in the long
moss-beards. “Green, fleshy chains” festoon themselves upon the
branches, and hang heavily on slender stems. They stretch taut from one
tree to another, or rigid, fasten tree-tops to the ground. The whole
jungle is knit together. If a supporting tree falls, the confused masses
of <i>lianas</i> adhering to it snatch at whatever is nearest for a fresh
start. They twist about each other tighter and tighter, gaining always a
firmer and firmer hold as they ascend. Far up above, they will weave
back and forth a close fabric, spreading out wide roofs of flowers.</p>

<p>Indistinguishable tree from creeper, parasite from supporter, all are
clamoring for space and light and air. Those which have struggled
through to the top reach toward the scalding sun or alternate cooling
deluge, riotous, irrepressible in vigor, radiant with color, distilling<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_253" id="page_253">{253}</a></span>
intense perfume, drooping with the succulence of their own leaves and
stems, breaking with the weight of their over-developed fruit.</p>

<p>Vegetation invades everything. It even shoots out over the water,
covering it with lovely forms. Hardly a growing thing can get its
impulse directly from the soil. That was long ago preëmpted. There must
be other things to grow upon or in. Wherever there is a suspicion of
foothold, a new form of life springs up spontaneously, gleaning
nourishment from whatever it touches, exuberantly prolific from the
start, parasites one and all, living at the expense of some earlier
comer.</p>

<p>Even parasites have their own parasitic growth. Parasites flourish as
trees self-grafted upon trees. Draperies and tapestries and motionless
cascades, this inundation of parasitic life falls back again to the
ground in great growing clumps. What indeed is a parasite?</p>

<p>Little rifts of color have collected here and there, concentrated deep
in the nooks and crevices of trees, moulded into orchid form. Some are
tiny as mosses and grow upon the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_254" id="page_254">{254}</a></span> dewy-looking, little
violet-colored flowers. Some lie upon the water, some droop over the
edge of precipices, their great mass of fleshy, aerial roots sucking
damp nourishment from the air. Certain trees seem destined by nature as
orchid gardens. Numberless varieties, each with its peculiar bearing,
perch upon the limbs, night-scented blossoms with a spongy texture
fringed and fluted in a thousand ways; beautiful monsters of crimson and
black, whose queer little phantom faces, with beards of fine hairs, make
mouths at you. Hot and moist, the imperceptible odor of each mingles
with the mass of other imperceptible odors, oppressive at last by sheer
force of numbers.</p>

<p>The habits of orchids, if so they may be called, are amazing; for
example: their attraction of insects and means of scattering their
pollen about on a moth’s body; their bright color luring day-flyers and
their strong odor night-flyers to the same flower; the elastic flaps, a
resource of others for a similar end. As Darwin said: “With parts
capable of movement and other parts endowed with something so like,
though no doubt really different from sen<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_255" id="page_255">{255}</a></span>sibility, they seem to us in
our ignorance as if modeled by the wildest caprice.”</p>

<p>Whimsical and wayward, restrained by no precedent, an orchid dares
defiance in all the properties it possesses, odor, form, and color, so
that the line of its descent is sometimes impossible to distinguish.
This anarchist of flowers throws out an unexpected leaf or petal
wherever it chooses, and if interfered with, refuses even to produce its
own blossoms, veering off in independence. The most elegant flower that
grows, able to conventionalize even nature herself by lusciously
designed leaves&mdash;patterns whose suitable background would be courts of
kings&mdash;riots here alone in “languid magnificence,” merely glanced at by
a passing humming-bird.</p>

<p>If a tree or a vine has a little less succulence than its neighbor or a
little less vital impulse, nature calmly watches it pounced upon and
extinguished. No one “compassionately tries to save the unfit from the
consequences of their unfitness.” Having endowed this prolific land, the
lavish elements can withdraw and survey unmoved the scattering showers
of seeds, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_256" id="page_256">{256}</a></span> prodigal industry of plants in busily perfecting seeds
which will never be given an opportunity to grow. So little chance has a
seed that new attempts at life are more secure if supplied by the energy
of the parent stem. The elements are not responsible for the
death-struggle of vegetation which results. As far as they are
concerned, each seed that falls and each little shoot that springs
upward would be given an equal chance. But every form being equally
favored, its neighbors contest its right to live. Coöperation to make
life possible at all, only begins when united force is needed to conquer
a common foe. Life here is for viper and vampire as well as for
butterfly, and the parasite has an equal chance with the benevolent
vine. It is a battlefield where militant nature fights in civil warfare
through the ages. Plants once given birth demand the right to make the
most of their own particular form of life, fighting for sun, fighting
for air, fighting for the right to live. Ironically enough, warfare is
fiercest between forms most closely allied. “They interlace, strangle,
and devour each other.” Parasitic alliances are possible only between
very diver<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_257" id="page_257">{257}</a></span>gent forms, each benefiting by the use of what the other does
not need. Parasites are leapt upon by other parasites; there is strife
even among them. Forever fighting with each other, they all suffer
equally from hereditary enemies descending from above or creeping up
from below, capturing by attack or poisoning by stealth.</p>

<p>Plants not only crowd their neighbors out of the soil, they seem to
dispute the air as well. Each begrudges the other a breathing space. The
ingenuity of nature is taxed to invent compensations to each for lack of
what it has a right to expect as its due. An impenetrable disguise of
buttresses is substituted for roots and want of underground space.
Air-roots drop from branches. Smaller trees, adapted to the dimness,
live in the shade of larger ones. Nature uses every subterfuge,
restrained by nothing known as customary. Plants maintain a life whose
pertinacity we have no scale for measuring. Each asserts its own
individuality and insists upon it with inexhaustible energy. Each is
convinced of its own desirability, convinced it was intended to live,
proclaiming that intention to the death of its neighbor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_258" id="page_258">{258}</a></span></p>

<p>Out of the remains of the dead arises a new generation with an increase
of vital impulse. The instant a plant has reached a sense of
completeness, it is sprung upon, twitched from decay into the vitality
of some lovely form whose time has come. Whatever lapses into the past
is at once metamorphosed. Whatever should look forward for opportunity
would be snuffed out by some exuberant growth determined on immediate
perfection.</p>

<p>There can be no seasons in the jungle, no general periods of growth,
maturity, or rest. All stages of development are flaunting from
independent plants in a single locality. Each is appropriating whatever
it can use in the elements or in its neighbor to weave into its own
perfecting tissue. Each is as little influenced by the other as are two
trees rubbing against each other with the wind, mingling their branches
and blending their foliage. Though forced during a lifetime to closest
proximity, they are members of remote families, and the nature of
neither is modified in the slightest degree.</p>

<p>Indeed, all seasons concentrate on a single tree; for some of the
massive fruits require<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_259" id="page_259">{259}</a></span> more than a year to ripen, so that fruit is
maturing and flowers are budding on the same tree.</p>

<p>Only heat can penetrate. Light is almost excluded by the unbroken canopy
of interlaced branches. It is left up above, absorbed into whirls of
vivid flower or expanding the luscious leaves. Heat and moisture are
imprisoned. Plants flourish in “the boundless, deep immensity of shade.”
Left in wan half-light they push up into the “green gloaming,” adapted
to the dimness yet straining upward to the light which would kill them
if they could reach it. Even bats sometimes make mistakes and emerge at
noonday, unhooking themselves from branches on which the sun has never
shone. All forms are confused, and the strange shapes but half-seen are
concealed by others no less vague.</p>

<p>Deep within the wilderness, more silent than the noiseless solitude
itself, lies a mysterious lagoon sacred to the giant Mother of Waters.
All about, coiled in the half-putrescent, vegetable mould, are myriads
of venomous creatures, gliding, writhing, crawling in and out. Minute
snakes, whose bite is death, curl in tendrils or lie like coral
necklaces upon the leaves. Larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_260" id="page_260">{260}</a></span> ones drape in vinelike garlands
overhead, to be distinguished from a blossoming festoon only by a
sudden, loose-swinging end.</p>

<p>But the pool! What wet blackness and horrid mystery! The surface of the
water is never ruffled by a breeze. It has no moods. Unperturbed in
perpetual gloom it lies in quivering stagnation, oozing nauseous odors
under the twilight of a full, tropical noon. No roseate spoonbill, no
delicate white heron tilts about upon its banks. The black, stagnant
water can barely cover the solid, seething mass of “hairy, scaly, spiny,
blear-eyed, bulbous, shapeless monsters, without name ... wallowing,
interwriggling, and devouring each other.”</p>

<p>Here sleeps the Mother of Waters, congenially imbedded, her shining
coils slipping about over each other&mdash;the great <i>yacumama</i>&mdash;the mighty
boa-constrictor, who can swallow almost any creature whole, and whose
breath withers any beast lured within reach by her fascinating poison.
Humanely she intoxicates before squeezing the unyielding bones to pulp
of digestible consistency.</p>

<p>Sometimes she unfolds her darkly iridescent<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_261" id="page_261">{261}</a></span> coils out into the
hospitable closeness of the jungle. Laboriously she winds upward in
over-arching trees; but, as if too languid, leaves part of her frightful
weight dragging below. She looks moss-grown, like the stem of an old
tree, and treelike, remains motionless for days at a time. When she does
wander forth in search of prey, a track follows through the lush,
yielding vegetation&mdash;her huge weight lingering heavily upon succulent
stems.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> atmosphere is full of color&mdash;weird, miasmic exhalations. Next to the
shade lingering under the dark velvet foliage on the edges of streams,
the glossy leaves toss off sheets of silver light or reflect a “russet
glamour” from their under sides. Beds of yellow butterflies settle along
river banks and concentrate the sunlight with blinding intensity. Every
leaf seems to blaze like a gem; even the black shadows pulsate with
inner light. It is part of jungle mystery that even the light comes in
iridescence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_262" id="page_262">{262}</a></span></p>

<p>Legions of beautifully colored spiders silently spin their geometric
webs. Insects all dipped in silver, with waving antennae laid back along
their heads, red beetles with golden heads and wings of chintz, buzz to
and fro. Moss-grown leaf-insects&mdash;ossified, living scarabs&mdash;walk about
on tree-trunks. Stinging bees and wasps fill chinks of jungle trees with
wild honey. Myriads of ants swarm: driver ants; parasol ants carrying a
bit of leaf about over their heads; fever-bearing ants, and ants that
live in the hollow, white stems of the cecropia tree and furnish the
sloth’s food. Centipedes hurry by, legs moving with “invisible rapidity
like a vibration,” and numerous flies, ticks, mosquitoes, cicadas,
dragon-flies. Some of these strange beings need two or three years of
larval life to prepare for a flight of a single hour, possibly after
sunset. What a limited idea of the world must they have who never see
the light of day!</p>

<p>We are assured that the unseen world is a very substantial place; so is
the microscopic. And an ear-trumpet reveals a new universe of sound.
What a region of ultra-violet murmur<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_263" id="page_263">{263}</a></span>ings must lie beyond that we never
catch at all! If only an elemental apperception can grasp the vastness
of the jungle, what can be said of the delicacy of its silver-point
drawing? For here is greatness on the invisible scale, “a creation at
the same time immense and imperceptible.”</p>

<p>Side by side with sloths, ant-eaters, and armadillos, dwarf descendants
of mastodon days, still lumbering about undeveloped in spite of their
ancient lineage, humming-birds have flashed through the ages. They have
profited by cycles of centuries to elaborate their little bodies beyond
imagination with pendent beards, crests, waving ear-tufts, and ornaments
colored in fantastic manner. Their tails, fashioned in queer shapes,
always consist of ten feathers. Even the tiny, sharp feet, minute as
they are, differ greatly in form and are sometimes covered with a
delicate, white down. There are feathers on a humming-bird’s eyelids.
The little saw-edged tongues for extracting insects from flower-honey
all differ. Their bills are as long as their bodies, and their tails are
twice as long.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_264" id="page_264">{264}</a></span></p>

<p>What can be said of their color, brighter than any other in nature? The
hue of every precious stone, the luster of every metal sparkles from
some part of the diminutive body. Often only a twinkling of
emerald-gold-green or ruby-colored light reveals their passing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A route of evanescence with a revolving wheel!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">Sometimes the flash comes from throat or back or brow of iridescence,
sometimes from a body sheathed in little gold scales; sometimes from the
very tips of long white feathers frilling the neck about. The colors
come and go, shift and change with every motion, “embers flung about by
in visible hands.” The wing feathers are gray. No eye could discern
anything but a dusky film, so a bright display would be lost!</p>

<p>And all this is within a thimble’s compass, for the smallest of all
humming-birds grows in Peru. It is hardly larger than a bumblebee, and
the giant of the race measures less than a swallow. Doctor Brehm says
the Dwarf Humming-bird is the only one that has a song.</p>

<p>There is as much diversity in the names of the humming-bird as in
everything else pertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_265" id="page_265">{265}</a></span>ing to it: Tresses-of-the-day-star,
Rays-of-the-sun, Sun-gems, Sun-stars, Flame-bearers, Frou-frou,
Pecker-of-flowers, Flower-sipper, Honey-sucker, Sipper-of-roses,
Fly-bird, and the sweet Colibri. It has, besides, many local names, as
Tominejo, <i>tomin</i> being the smallest weight.</p>

<p>Birds migrate south from the tropics as well as north. The humming-bird
whirls through the jungle and luxuriant valleys of the Andes, out to
islands in the Pacific, and follows the fuchsia down to the very
boundaries of barrenness in the tail of South America. A mere dab of
brain can engineer this infinitesimal motor from Patagonia to Canada.
One minute Flame-bearer lives only inside the crater of an extinct
volcano in Veragua, marked with red like the fire-stealer wren of
Brittany, and many battle with storms of the high Andes and can be seen
mingling their vivid flashes with snow. They who live by means of
flowers! One called Sappho, a blend of red and green, lives upon the
bleak heights of Bolivia, frequenting the haunts of the condor.</p>

<p>It has been thought that the humming-bird has no wish-bone, its frame
being more compact<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_266" id="page_266">{266}</a></span> than such construction would allow, in order to
withstand the immense strain of its wings&mdash;immense, yes, measured by
millimeters. At any rate the largest organ is the breast muscle, and the
heart is three times as large as the stomach. Its senses are alert, and
a well developed skull could prove the excellence of the brain beneath
did not its habits do so.</p>

<p>The humming-bird always trusts itself to the air for however brief a
distance, and flings its supple body about from one flower to another in
vibrating flight. Now it hovers near without disordering a petal, now it
hangs from tall grasses by the tip of its thornlike bill, a sparkling of
wings with spurts of precious stones in a setting of petals, lost in
another instant in wide air.</p>

<p>Never smutted by earth, because never touching it, the humming-bird
juggles among the flowers. It never follows all the flowers of a single
bush nor even exhausts all the sweetness of a single flower&mdash;“a dart, a
glance, a sip, and away;” butterflies, a symbol of caprice, are not more
fickle. This utterly erratic creature performing its aerial gambols
holds within itself the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_267" id="page_267">{267}</a></span> reason for its being unmolested by any
enemy&mdash;the chase not being worth the morsel!</p>

<p>Ineffable is the whole field of its labor. The coarsest materials of its
nests are the finest straws it can pick up. Inside they are lined with
down and spiders’ webs. Consistently they are attached to a pendent
branch or long-swinging vine. Thither the humming-bird flies to supply a
family’s microscopic wants.</p>

<p>To a giant looking through a microscope, what a revelation of the
infinite industry of nature in worlds beyond the grasp of any sense of
his, the humming-bird would be!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_268" id="page_268">{268}</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IVc" id="CHAPTER_IVc"></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><br />
ANIMALS OF DARKNESS AND LIGHT</h3>

<h4>I</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> a land of silence! The vast forest seems wholly uninhabited save
for the chatter of a passing train of harlequin parrots or angry apes.
And yet it is not silence. There is the great movement of lapsing and
becoming perpetually going on; both composition and decomposition
rustling on toward completion. They are mere phases of that “illimitable
sun force which destroys as swiftly as it generates and generates again
as swiftly as it destroys.”</p>

<p>“So fast do the flowers expand that an actual heat, which may be tested
by the thermometer, is given off during fructification.” The tepid water
forces all growing things to prodigious size. Exuberance seems to have
no boundaries. The length of the young shoots is only less amazing than
their growth in a single day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_269" id="page_269">{269}</a></span> Leaves expand until they are twenty feet
long, and ferns tangle their own fronds in haste to push out to the
utmost limit of their nature. One sees things growing in the damp heat
as one hears a yucca palm grow.</p>

<p>But where growth is on a stupendous scale, there decay is exuberant, for
“the powers that build are the powers that putrefy.” Above are light,
warmth, and moisture: such are conditions of growth. Below are darkness,
warmth, and moisture: such are conditions of decay. Which is more
effectual, that mighty power of evolution elaborating “the rain-water
hurrying aloft” into tissue of leaf and flower, or those great forces of
dissolution which can so soon transmute the fallen trunk of iron-wood
into a pregnant, humid mound? It merely lapses into those elements
composing it, and is instantly absorbed by fresh leaves culminating
to-night.</p>

<p>The noble heat blends the smell of laboring sap and that of aromatic
mosses with the pungent odor of decay, the damp smell of death with
those sweet poisons which drip off the trees and envelop like a caress.
The incense tree was described by Martin Fernandez de<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_270" id="page_270">{270}</a></span> Enciza in the
early sixteenth century. “Incense doth hang at its boughs,” he said, “as
the ice doth at the tiles of a house in the winter season.” Over-ripe
fruit drops smashing on the ground with scent of strawberries. A musky
humming-bird leaves behind a thin trail of heady perfume. The air is
filled with vegetable breath, weird, far-off blossoms, mere ghosts of
fragrance mingling in a wave of sweetness. Smell is indeed man’s most
emotional sense. It gives a poignancy to a remembered scene which no
detailed picture can, and sharpens the whole sight perception. An entire
chapter should be written about jungle-perfume.</p>

<p>The silence of day is succeeded by the “soundless tune” that fills the
night. It surges up from below and shuts down from above. Pervasive as
the murmuring of water, it spreads out through the night, pierced by a
sudden brilliant squeak near at hand. With darkness settles a humming,
booming, drumming, croaking, deafening uproar from thousands of
diversified insect throats filling up every chink of space, each one
crowding out the other. Insects here are not a miniature, far-off
chorus, one ingre<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_271" id="page_271">{271}</a></span>dient of a summer night, but overwhelming, terrifying,
absorbing the dark atmosphere.</p>

<p>Mysterious animals live in the depths of the ocean where no ray of light
has ever pierced. They light the way for their own fishing, as the
glow-worm is struck by its own brightness before seeing any other.
Fire-beetles and phosphorescent caterpillars and flickering
fireflies&mdash;little stitches of a shining thread in the soft, verdured
blackness of the tepid night&mdash;make the primeval forest discernible.</p>

<p>The true life of the jungle begins with darkness and ends with light. As
if the habitual gloom were not deep enough, jungle animals wait until
night has enclosed them further to carry on their life activities, those
weird creatures which lurk in the shade, primeval instincts always
alert, living on suffrance in this land of vegetation. They have
persisted since early geologic ages, the only remnants of their kind,
haunting the nights from then until now. Dwarfs of a former age, growing
constantly smaller and fewer and less important, they will dwindle
through coming ages until zoölogical gardens can no longer be supplied,
and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_272" id="page_272">{272}</a></span> toothless skulls in glass cases will be the only evidence
that they ever existed.</p>

<p>The antediluvian ant-eater hunches along on his stiff, curved claws,
stopping now and then to rake out a crowded ant-hill, whose compact,
crawling interior he cleans out with an efficient slash of his spiral
tongue.</p>

<p>The giant armadillo, the glyptodon of former ages, developed a complete
coat-of-mail by which his small descendant is still protected. He can
open and shut the scales at will, hiding himself inside them. He
trundles to and fro, burrowing out well-flavored roots. His voice is
dull, without ring or expression. But his little shell is used as the
bowl of a curious, three-stringed guitar from which natives can coax
sweet sounds.</p>

<p>The tapir is another twilight animal, protected by his enormously thick
hide. He snuffs about with his long snout, follows paths made by himself
to the water, and sounds his queer whistle as alarm.</p>

<p>The cavernous croak of the violet-colored throat-bladder matches the
twilight. The goat-sucker, with softly flapping wings, rises to greet
the night, and from deep within the forest re<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_273" id="page_273">{273}</a></span>sounds the drawling cry of
the sloth. His small, ghoulish face peers into the oncoming darkness.</p>

<p>Night settles. Bloodthirsty bats emerge, bright eyes flashing eagerly.
Leaf-nosed vampires, whose empire is gloom, are prepared for their
nightly bacchanale.</p>

<p>When utter blackness has obliterated the jungle, the <i>carbunculo</i> slinks
slowly out of the thickets. “If followed, he opens a flap in his
forehead from under which an extraordinary brilliant and dazzling light
issues, proceeding from a precious stone; any foolhardy person who
ventures to grasp at it is blinded, the flap is let down under the long
black hair and the animal disappears into darkness. The Incas believed
in him. The viceroys in their official instructions to the missionaries,
placed the <i>carbunculo</i> in the first order of desiderata.”</p>

<p>With great broad strokes the tropical butterfly descends at sunset time
to the jungle pool. The soft color of its wings is hardly
distinguishable from the mold. It sips the water quietly.</p>

<p>A small bird, ready for a feast, swoops down with a whir of wings ...
but where is the butterfly? In its place is a fierce owl, bulging eyes
flashing, and every feather on his head bristling in eagerness for his
prey. The little bird of supper-intentions has precipitately departed,
never to return, a permanent lesson learned in the terror of an instant;
yet it was learned from the under side of a butterfly.</p>

<p>Who so much as a butterfly is a child of the sun? Evoked by his warmth,
it comes forth with all facilities developed for the fullest enjoyment
of a new life, in which it seeks out the sun-spaces in the damp forest.
What a direct response to warmth in the up and down motion of a
butterfly’s wings, wide-spread on a sunny mass of leaves! How quickly it
folds its lustrous wings and sinks, drooping, upon a flower when the sun
goes in, as rainbows disappear at the sun’s withdrawal!</p>

<p>Nor does its sun-worship end here; for Iris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_275" id="page_275">{275}</a></span> symbol of the sun, is
imprisoned upon its wings. Those magic wings! Nature writes upon them
all the changes which the organism undergoes, the patterns of the minute
feathers, the direction of the fine veins, their shapes, their
pencillings varying with the slightest external change. Each can be
distinguished from all the rest by what is written on these evanescent
tablets, the most delicate on which laws have ever been inscribed.</p>

<p>The Peruvian butterflies have a world-wide reputation, from the
triple-tailed <i>theclas</i> making up in elegance of form for their
diminutive size, to the azure <i>morphos</i>, those noble insects as large as
two hands laid side by side, the desideratum of collectors who press
their burnished wings between glass walls. Abnormal tails reach in
abnormal directions like ingrowing horns, sharply pointed and oddly
curved. An imp-like dot of silver near by calls attention to them. Bold,
uneven blotches of gold and black are surrounded by demure, parallel
lines. A spot of crimson pulsates in the midst of a whole wing of
iridescence. The extravagant creature carries his black velvet body
about on yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_276" id="page_276">{276}</a></span> legs. Some are as finely mottled as partridge feathers.
In others the design just glimmers through mother-of-pearl. Some are
transparent in color, a stained glass window leaded in design with
living veins. The spaces between veins, however small, are exquisitely
fashioned, and always the corresponding patterns of the two sides are
perfectly aligned. Some are transparent like dragon-flies’ wings. Some
are almost veinless, visible only by a dip of color on the tip of the
wing&mdash;phantom butterflies. From others, apparently colorless, certain
lights can flash the segment of a rainbow.</p>

<p>What fine fitness in a French expression for the blues&mdash;<i>papillons
noirs</i>!</p>

<p>Many of the most brilliant butterflies are so colored because they are
unpalatable, even uneatable, flaunting their warnings in the face of the
lizard, which might eat them unawares were they not so conspicuous. They
can flutter lazily about, with no attempt at concealment, preserved by
their own poison. In making the injurious butterfly resplendent, nature
saves both the butterfly and the bird which might have gulped it down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_277" id="page_277">{277}</a></span></p>

<p>Others are preserved by having adopted bark-designs or leaf-color or
twig-shapes. Some even float about mimicking each other, if advantageous
to do so. Some gain protection by imitating the brilliantly colored but
uneatable butterflies for which they are mistaken. Mimicry or warning,
each protects as is most beneficial, by concealing or making
conspicuous. Seen and recognized, they are not molested; or, hidden,
they escape notice.</p>

<p>How varied are their habits! Poisonous ones fly slowly. Others merely
frisk about, toying with life, air, and sunlight; skirt-dancers they are
called (<i>megaluras</i>), “sown and carried away again by the light air.”
Some heavy-bodied butterflies gain protection by flight so rapid as to
make them mistaken for humming-birds. The broad, strong strokes of the
wide-winged <i>morphos</i> float them across wide rivers. The flight of
butterflies is a biologist’s problem, as well as their colored juices
and seasonal forms.</p>

<p>Some, flying low, have their greatest brilliancy on the under side of
the wings; others, flying high, are dull underneath to protect them from
enemies below, as the bell-bird, whose home is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_278" id="page_278">{278}</a></span> in the dazzling sunshine
above the tree-tops, is made invisible to any eyes looking upward by its
snow-white plumage and transparent wings.</p>

<p>“Crepuscular” butterflies emerge at sunset. Such are the <i>caligos</i>,
amazing creatures equipped on the under side with an owl’s head, which
can terrify their pursuers by merely turning wrong side out. All animals
are suspicious of a strange-looking eye; and at dusk, when the butterfly
descends to the jungle pool to drink, the owl-eyes are particularly
effective. The harmless butterfly spreads the one view of itself to the
enemy which could save its life, and continues slowly to sip the dark
water.</p>

<p>Some butterflies stop in the gloomiest shades of the forest in darkness
of noon. They all love the damp, and quantities of them surround
puddles. Some settle with wings erect, some expand them and rest head
downward, pressed closely against the supporting surface. The
“swallow-tails” never allow their long tails to touch anything. Some
alight upon the end of a stick, others rest upon dead leaves, others
upon rocks or sand, some on the under surface of leaves, entirely
disappearing when they alight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_279" id="page_279">{279}</a></span> While some are protected for motion,
others are protected for rest. Flickering noiselessly into the deep, wet
shade in the network of vines and succulent leaves, they flash out into
the clear sunlight. The glow of colors pulsates on their shining blue
wings, intense as the fathomless blaze of a fragment of copper-saturated
driftwood. Creatures of the sky they are, indeed, touched with the
celestial hue. It was not without reason that the Greeks gave the same
name to this wondrous insect and to the soul.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_280" id="page_280">{280}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">he lives upon cecropia buds and dew, as Doctor Brehm declares, or upon
armies of ants swarming in the hollow stems of the cecropia tree, it is
certain that he haunts only that tree, which spreads out broad leaves
whose white, lower sides reflect light into the sepulchral shade. It
furnishes him with more food than he needs, and food is his only
necessity.</p>

<p>The rain pours, he listlessly hugs his branch, a sorry spectacle,
emitting from time to time a deep sigh. His eye is dull, he knows no
joy, no sorrow. He needs no sleep, no relief from a life which is
nothing but respite. The odds seem too great against him to perform the
simplest acts of life.</p>

<p>The climax of activity is reached when, like a wad, he falls to the
ground, apparently devoid of life.</p>

<p>After a while he unrolls and progresses with circumspection upon closed
claws to the next cecropia tree. Then he climbs to the very top, where
he begins to eat, supplied with food on the down journey. Hunger
compelling, he unbends from a position of unusual discomfort and pushes
himself along his branch upside down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_282" id="page_282">{282}</a></span> Over-cautious in every motion, he
never loosens his rigid hold from one limb until securely clamped to the
next one. Each movement causes a long, sad yowl of pain. It is amazing
that so cutting a sound can issue from his soft mouth.</p>

<p>His weird cry is a jungle symbol&mdash;mysterious hint of antediluvian days
when the elephantine sloth lifted up a mammoth wail to be taken up by
the glyptodon and the dodo.</p>

<p>In the desert man exclaims: “If only there were water! The soil is
fertile. There is sunlight and warmth enough to make a tropical
paradise. If only there were water!” And so, although he does not
exactly worship water as the Yuncas of antiquity did, this man sings
secretly in his heart a hymn to the god of water.</p>

<p>Up on the icy highlands man exclaims: “If only there were warmth! The
soil is fertile, there is plenty of water, only warmth is lacking to
make a paradise. If only there were warmth!” And he sympathizes with the
Incas, whose god was the Sun, and waits through the long night-watches
until, with his rising, life is renewed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_283" id="page_283">{283}</a></span></p>

<p>In the jungle, water brings fertility to a soil bathed in the light and
warmth of a tropical sun. It pours down from melting snows of the
mountain-tops and gushes from the ground to meet the rain. Here, where
man might live with least effort, he squats on the lowest rung of the
human ladder, his savage desires satisfied as soon as realized. The sun
needs no propitiatory offerings, water needs no exhortation. Invisible
powers have conferred all gifts which his mind could imagine or his
heart desire.</p>

<p>But in the midst of luxuriant plenty, like the Indian above the mine,
poverty-struck for want of the very riches he sits upon, he is merely
dying out for lack of everything with which he is surrounded. With a
remedy at his command for every ill, he hangs about his neck a string of
tapirs’ claws in case of need. As there is lack of nothing to supply his
wants, so there are few wants to be supplied. A whole tribe lives on a
single species of tree, like insects depending on one fruit or leaf for
subsistence, or the sloth hanging on the cecropia tree, which has senses
sufficient to appreciate sights and sounds and smells, but remains
insensible. The jungle<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_284" id="page_284">{284}</a></span> people seem to recognize the likeness and call
one another “beast of the cecropia tree.”</p>

<p>As there is surplus of everything here, evil gifts have been bestowed as
well. Poisonous insects sting for life; the fierce jaguar and fatal
vampire, whose velvet kisses are a death-brand, bite for life; so do
snakes; and the huge boa crushes the bones of its victim. The strong
attack the weak, the cunning inveigle the unwary. Injurious or
beneficent, all must fight for life, joining in the great struggle. Each
variety contends with every other, vegetation fights to keep out
animals, animals with birds, insects with one another, and all against
the water, whose level silently rises over its foes. So man must
struggle against nature. The jungle is his only teacher. He takes from
it what it offers. He is the mere imitator of the vegetable world, a
product of it in modified form. He sees strife in air, earth, and water.
His religion can conceive only strife of two extremes, dying and living,
evil and good, one injurious, the other beneficial. Evil spirits inhabit
birds and beasts and whirlpools of the mighty rivers. The dim forest is
filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_285" id="page_285">{285}</a></span> powers of destruction. They lurk in the black lizard and
less dangerous ones in the parroquets. Since all sickness is brought by
evil spirits, it is they to whom prayers are made. Some jungle savages
believe in a transformation into animals and name their children for
them. If there are any thoughts of a future life, they are in jungle
terms. After death these people wish to be turned into animals, which
sometimes happens. “On the eighth day a red deer jumped from the grave
and ran away into the forest. They did not see the soul enter the deer,
but they saw the deer rise from the grave”! Some worship sun and moon,
an Inca custom. But the moon with its phases and its weird shadows in
the jungle is involved in special mystery. These savages understand the
jungle, but facts plain to us compose their mystery.</p>

<p>If a man is sick, something grows near by to set him all right again.
They use nature’s remedies against her poisons, as they have learned
from birds and beasts to do. They collect various sympathetic medicines,
such as teeth of poisonous snakes, and carefully fix them in leaves and
tubes of rushes&mdash;powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_286" id="page_286">{286}</a></span> specifics against headache and blindness.
They fill flask-gourds with balsams, and collect odorous gum for
incense.</p>

<p>War is their only object lesson, so quite naturally their only
preëminence is in the art of killing. The chief cause of war is stealing
of women; some are worth as much as a hatchet, some only the price of a
knife. In times of fighting the savages howl through a giant reed in
blood-curdling discord. They shoot with parrot-feathered cactus-arrows
dipped in famous poisons, or thrust through an enemy with a <i>macana</i>&mdash;a
wooden sword as sharp as steel&mdash;or fell him with a club of wood like
iron. Then they make drums of his skin to serve as warning to his
friends. They protect themselves with a shield of creeping plants
interwoven, covered with a tapir skin and edged with the feathers of
parrots.</p>

<p>The only amicable exchanges between tribes are the poisons done up in
reeds into which they will dip the arrows used each against the other.
Some poisons, made by women and old men, can kill an animal without
injuring his flesh for the use of man. Some make him merely wither<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_287" id="page_287">{287}</a></span>
away. Some do not take effect until three days after the wound is
inflicted.</p>

<p>The whole history of man, beginning with the Stone Age, could be studied
among the wild tribes of Amazonian Peru. The largest tribe numbers
nearly twenty-five thousand, many but a few families, and one tribe has
now not a single member left. Differing each from the other, they are
similar only in that they all represent the first steps of human
development.</p>

<p>A savage of the jungle perforates his face to insert feathers and
shells; he gouges it with sharp flints and rubs in indelible color. He
slashes his lips both within and without and stretches his ear-lobes as
far as the shoulder. Then he inserts knobs of <i>chonta</i>-palm wood. He
paints his face yellow and suspends a red bean from his nose. Or he
paints his face in the four quarters, blue, yellow, red, and black, and
dyes his hair red with <i>achote</i>, his body orange with <i>armatto</i>,
staining it in design with dark juices. The Prios color their teeth;
others leave their teeth unstained and wear a long, yellow mantle. The
Conibo flattens his head, or that of his child, between boards into
fantastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_288" id="page_288">{288}</a></span> shapes, leaving holes through which the cranium can develop.
He leaves single locks of hair on conspicuous promontories. Toucans’
feathers are stuck to them with wax. On days of celebration he dances in
ropes of iridescent birds strung through the bills, his bead girdles of
barbaric design hung with humming-birds as tassels. He knows no fashion
but personal caprice. There is no limit to the vagaries of the world
about him, neither are any suggested for his own decoration. Cross-wise
over his shoulders he slings long scarfs of brilliantly colored birds
hung at the end of chains made of their little leg-bones, along with
boxes of poison for his arrow-heads. His necklaces are of the teeth of
jaguars, wildcats, and monkeys, or of the curling teeth of the
white-lipped peccary. From his anklets and wristlets of heavy, wooden
beans he shakes a jungle call, wielding a feather scepter in savage
rhythm about the stiff feather halo upon his head.</p>

<p>As might be expected, the jungle savage adores music, if so it may be
called. He imitates the cries of forest animals. Some tribes have war
songs; then they use a bone flute or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_289" id="page_289">{289}</a></span> reed. The Aguarunas have a
violin with three strings. This is the most intelligent tribe, but they
use their superior intelligence in reducing the heads of their enemies.
One is often compelled to wonder whether greater brain-development means
greater usefulness.</p>

<p>These seem to be the facts: The head of an enemy being cut off, poisons
are poured into it, softening the bones so that they can be drawn out
through the neck. They are then replaced by red-hot stones to which the
head, reduced to one-fifth its original size, adjusts itself in the
steam of a bonfire made of roots of certain palms.</p>

<p>A jungle story runs that a scientist from Germany tried to investigate
these sinister processes. But his head, in miniature form, was soon
stuck upon a pole. It could be recognized by the long, reddish beard,
which had retained its original proportions.</p>

<p>To qualify as a warrior a youth must possess at least one reduced head
of his own making. As time goes on, he adorns himself with more and more
such trophies.</p>

<p>Some similar custom existed on the coast in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_290" id="page_290">{290}</a></span> ancient times, for these
little masks have been found in the <i>huacas</i> (grave mounds). The first
reduced heads were exhibited in Lima in 1862 under the rare title,
“Heads of the Incas”!</p>

<p>The Macas and Jivaros are believed to have this practice as well, and a
tribe exists near the Cusicuari, the Rio Negro, and the Orinoco,
reported as able to reduce entire bodies in the same manner.</p>

<p>Some tribes preserve their enemies’ hands, others keep their teeth, and
some eat their enemies whole. A man speaking a different dialect is
eaten like an animal of a different species. The Amahuacas pulverize the
bones and eat the ashes in their food, in order to absorb the physical
strength as well as the moral virtues of the person gone before.
Although they are never eaten, the women of cannibal tribes are said to
be more cannibalistic than the men. Prior to such feasts they fatten the
prisoners of war, who “rather enjoy the prospect, and gorge themselves
to accommodate their keepers. They occupy themselves tranquilly with
their duties as slaves without attempting to escape.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_291" id="page_291">{291}</a></span>”</p>

<p>Another practice of the Aguarunas is making the <i>tundoy</i>, or <i>tunduli</i>,
their jungle signal-service. They hollow a tree-trunk and make three
holes in it with red-hot stones, then hang it aloft on a high tree,
fastening the lower end securely to the ground. Blows upon it with a
wooden mallet reverberate as far as ten miles, and form a code, by their
swiftness or slowness and their pitch above, between, or below the
holes. As a hundred words suffice for a language, so would three tones
for a drum of war. Primitive man in the primeval jungle sending
blood-curdling signals to reduce the heads of his enemies!
Reverberations whose wave-lengths are intercepted on their echoing
passage through the forest by the flight of royal butterflies and
challenged by the chatter of antediluvian apes!</p>

<p>The weaker tribes are actually, not in name merely, pushed back into the
woods. Many traits in us find a literal, physical parallel in them. We
speak of “licking the dust;” in the jungle there are tribes of
earth-eating savages. A civilized man in the jungle learns their literal
ways. He puts gunpowder on the bite of a serpent and cauterizes by
igniting it. Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_292" id="page_292">{292}</a></span> no language adequately to express the venomous
thoughts they may feel, they use poisoned arrows. They literally reduce
an enemy’s head, and are more humane than we, doing it after death!</p>

<p>The Inje-inje represent the Stone Age, both in their tools and language.
They come out of inaccessible hiding-places to perform their primeval
rites by full moon and are the least known of all the savage tribes.
This small tribe of the Inje-inje, whose name is the sum of their
language, need only a word to steer their craft through life. As has
been said, the development of language from the primitive Inje-inje to
the somewhat developed Aguaruna can be studied in this mysterious place.
No tribe can count further than ten; most of them use only a movement of
the fingers. Though there are hundreds of “languages,” not one Amazonian
tribe can write.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>In temperate zones nature is to be relied upon. Roots grow in the
ground, branches and leaves in the air, flowers come forth at certain
seasons, and fruit follows. Trees give us shade<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_293" id="page_293">{293}</a></span> in which no fever
lurks. Vegetables do not relieve agony and want, as insects and plants
do not cause it. No animals lie in wait to seize us, no snakes to uncurl
and engulf us. Rain comes in measurable quantities. We live on a
tempered, miniature scale. We can afford to neglect reckoning with
nature, for we understand her laws, and we direct her by that
understanding.</p>

<p>But what can be said of the jungle? Had we thought of gardens as
suitably placed in tree-tops? Or of an edge of wood as sharp as an edge
of steel? Here accustomed flowers grow as shrubs, and shrubs as trees.
It is a region where insects are mistaken for birds, where animals
imitate a flower on the branch where they like to rest; where plants
have fragrance, and blossoms burst forth from roots or rough bark; where
birds gain protection by assuming the dazzling colors of tropical
sunlight, and butterflies by the warning colors of their neighbors. It
is a region where roots grow in the air; oils, wax, and honey are
secreted by leaves; where the death of anything gives new, vital impulse
to something else, and parasites<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_294" id="page_294">{294}</a></span> are as significant as their
supporters. Curious region, where there are night-flying butterflies and
softly-feathered moths to fly in the daytime; where everything is
reversed: animals, whose normal is upside down, prefer tree-tops to the
ground, birds of prey are frightened by the painting on a butterfly’s
wings, caterpillars sting, spiders kill birds, and water is the
principal element of the land.</p>

<p>Dramatic indeed is the silent jungle. The insect is imprisoned in the
throat of the orchid, whose honey it had been unwarily seeking. Trees
distil venom. Plants have fangs. Perfumes affect the brain. Cold, green
creepers blister like fire. From vampires which suck your blood as you
sleep, to the touch of a vine which paralyzes your entire body, the
jungle knows all modes of attack and furnishes the cure for every ill it
has created.</p>

<p>What can be taken as the symbol of the jungle? The snake, mysterious,
deadly, bound together in savage traditions with lightning, wind,
fire-streams of lava, and river-whirlpools, those emblems of serpent
treachery? Or butterflies, with their symbolism of life-recurrent?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_295" id="page_295">{295}</a></span> Or
the orchid, emblem of wayward unwholesomeness? In the troops of monkeys
which skip, swing, bounce from tree to tree, throwing themselves to be
caught by prehensile tails, is its exuberance. In the honey dripping
from hollow trees and running off unused, is typified its surplus.
Iridescence darting from insects and from birds, rainbows glinting over
cataracts or caught by the equatorial sunshine from misty hillsides,
might be its symbol; or the beneficence of jungle trees and bushes.</p>

<p>Not one would be more or less typical than any other. All are equally
emblematic. If we think of caprice, there is law; of life, there is
death; of beauty, there is horror. When each seems most dominant, then
its opposite is most uncontrolled.</p>

<p>The seed dies that the plant may live; the blossom withers that the
fruit may set; the worm vanishes that the butterfly may spread its wide
wings and fly. Plus and minus signs are never far apart indeed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_296" id="page_296">{296}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION"></a>CONCLUSION</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Peru</span> is the Land of the Sun. Its light and heat descend upon the coast
with tropical fury, reducing the desert to a shimmering vibration which
breathes back scorching odors toward the sun. The sun alone makes life
possible upon the arctic heights where, in Inca days, it was worshipped
in name as well as in fact. Yet beyond the mountain-barrier the same
constant sun has no longer undisputed sway. The jungle is “almost
uninhabitable through too great abundance of waters.” Peru is the Land
of Water, without which the desert is barren, because of which the
jungle is luxuriant.</p>

<p>But the sun, the god of Peru, controls the water. It can combine with
its opposing element. It is able to transfigure even the rain, which,
like human hopes, becomes iridescent because the sun shines. The rainbow
is a willing Ariel, the servant of each, retreating from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_297" id="page_297">{297}</a></span> the sun only
as far as the rain allows and illumining the rain only as far as the sun
permits.</p>

<p>The rainbow is visible nature’s alphabet. In terms of it are spelled sky
and sea, trees, birds, and flowers. It shoots the desert-mists and
twinkles along the streams which intersect it. It fearlessly embraces
the austere crags of the mountain-peaks and shimmers in the craters of
volcanoes.</p>

<p>Entire it flings itself from the heart of a shower, follows the waves of
the sea along, or glints on a butterfly’s wings or from a humming-bird’s
throat.</p>

<p>It reveals the elements of the stars, it lists the ingredients of the
sun, and sets down upon its ephemeral tablet the red-hot vapors rising
from the desert. Even the breath of the volcano has a place in the
rainbow alphabet.</p>

<p>It is hard to avoid so fundamental a thing. Close your eyes in the
sunlight, and its whole scale is thrown in glistening repetition across
your own eyelashes.</p>

<p>Even the ultra-violet&mdash;the unknown, the unperceived&mdash;must be discussed
in rainbow terms, the only letters the eye’s alphabet knows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_298" id="page_298">{298}</a></span></p>

<p>The Incas chose it for an empire’s emblem and dedicated to it a temple
close to that of the Sun.</p>

<p>It symbolized to the Spaniards the astounding country which had fallen
as by miracle into their grasp, the land of mystery, whose romantic
wealth and dazzling promises encircled them as with the rainbow arch,
and, like it, receded as they advanced.</p>

<p>Peru still keeps the rainbow symbol. Many-colored mysteries hover about
the man who leans over its glittering jewel-casket. And wherever the
ends of its bright bow touch the desert, flit over the mountain-tops, or
sweep across the jungle, nature’s unexplored secrets lie concealed.</p>

<p>There is, however, a difference. For the rainbow-arch which mingles
sunlight and water is only an evanescent promise, vanishing almost as
quickly as it can flash a new gleam of hope into a human heart. But
Peru, with its changing beauties and its mysterious allurements, is a
fact. The pot of gold which it promises is real.</p>

<p class="fint">THE END</p>

<h2><a name="BIBLIOGRAPHY" id="BIBLIOGRAPHY"></a>BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the general works on Peru none has greater weight than <i>Peru;
Beobachtungen und Studien</i> (1893) by E. W. Middendorf. He has exploited
the country in a large, three-volume work with such German thoroughness
that hardly a fact has been left for subsequent writers to disclose. I
have referred to it constantly. Other shorter, general studies of the
country are Von Tschudi’s <i>Reisen durch Südamerika</i>, giving much
attention to folk-lore, and <i>Twenty Years’ Residence in South America</i>
(1825) by W. B. Stevenson, secretary to Lord Cochrane. He traveled far
and wide in Peru and made observations in regard to remote details.
Typical of descriptive writings is <i>Two Years in Peru</i> (1876) by T. J.
Hutchinson. Various general works by Bernard Moses and his publications
in the <i>University of California Chronicle</i> are valuable, notably his
work on the produce of the mines.</p>

<p>Reliable observations on ruins are those made by E. G. Squier in his
<i>Peru: Travel and Exploration in the Land of the Incas</i>, by Mariano
Rivero y Juan de Tschudi in <i>Antiguedades Peruanas</i>, and by Charles
Wiener in <i>Pérou et Bolivie</i>. Studies of ruins in particular localities
have been made by many archaeologists; for example, on Tiahuanacu, L.
Angrand, in <i>Antiquités Américaines</i>, though his book is now out of
date, Adolph F. Bandelier in his <i>Islands of Titicaca and Koati</i>, Max
Uhle, with whom I visited some of the ruins, on Tiahuanacu and
Pachacamac, and Hiram Bingham in recent explorations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_300" id="page_300">{300}</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Clements Markham has spent more than fifty years studying every
stage of Peru’s history from the time when it was a land of myth to the
Chilian war. His researches as well as his careful translations have
been published in a series of volumes. Authorities on various periods of
the history are legion. Relating to pre-Inca times, in which studies of
myths and theories of ruins are intermingled, original sources are the
<i>Memorias Historiales</i> of Montesinos, first published in French in 1840,
and Cieza de Leon, the soldier, whose <i>Crónica del Perú</i> (1553) is
authority on the Incas. Some modern scientists who have written about
the pre-Inca period are Ernest Desjardins in his <i>Pérou avant la
Conquête Espagnole</i>, Tylor’s <i>Primitive Culture</i>, Meyen’s <i>Uber die
Ureinwohner von Peru</i>, and Brinton in his <i>Myths of the New World</i> and
other works. Many persons are studying the legends, as, for instance,
Professor Liborio Zerda of the University at Bogotá. The <i>Miscelaneas
Australes</i> of Miguel Cavello Balboa, a soldier, is an original source
for knowledge of the remote Chimus. <i>Das Reich der Chimus</i> by Otto von
Buchwald, and especially <i>Das Muchik oder die Chimu Sprache</i> by Doctor
Middendorf, who quotes largely from Calancha and Carrera, are modern
authorities.</p>

<p>In regard to the Incas: As a background there are the old, picturesque
chronicles which read like romances, but on which reposes most of the
knowledge that modern authorities have corroborated in regard to the
earlier inhabitants of Peru. These contemporary accounts have to be
carefully studied in order to distinguish fact from fiction. Next to the
<i>Crónica</i> of Cieza de Leon are the <i>Comentarios Reales</i> of Garcilasso de
la Vega, in whose own veins the turbulent blood of the Conquistador
mingled with the blood of the Sun. During his lifetime the imperial race
of his mother was exterminated by the fierce adventurers becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_301" id="page_301">{301}</a></span>
grandees, of whom his father was one. His book has the value of personal
reminiscence. His enthusiasm adds a certain glamor; but even if his
unique work has been spurned as an Utopian romance, it has been
reluctantly accredited as the foundation of facts set forth by its
critics. <i>De las Antiguas Gentes del Perú</i> by Bartolomé de las Casas,
works by Diego Fernandez, Betanzos, Oviedo, Sarmiento, Cobo, Ondegardo,
Molina’s <i>Fables and Rites of the Incas</i>, and the great <i>Miscelaneas</i> of
Balboa must be consulted. Many of them have been translated by Sir
Clements Markham and published by the Hakluyt Society of London.</p>

<p>It is bewildering to try to single out one or two modern works upon the
Incas, for their name is legion. The definitive authority in English is
of course Sir Clements Markham, whose <i>Incas of Peru</i> (1910) has
followed numberless more detailed works of his own upon the subject.</p>

<p><i>Der Belus oder Sonnendienst auf den Anden oder Kelten in America</i> by
Frenzel, presents one field of theory which observations on the remains
of the Incas’ walls suggest. The temptation to interpret by means of
analogies to other remote civilizations is withstood with difficulty.
From John Ranking and his <i>Historical Researches on the Conquest of Peru
by the Mongols</i>, to Ignatius Donnelly and his evidence in favor of its
conquest by the Egyptians via Atlantis, Peru has given an unlimited
field for speculation. Lord Bacon believed, by the way, that Peru was a
proud kingdom in the time of Atlantis. A striking example of immense
erudition expended on a futile, though technically well-supported,
fancy, is Rudolph Falb’s <i>Das Land der Inca</i>. Painstaking scholars are
tracing out similarities between the Peruvian language and the Semitic
and Phoenician tongues&mdash;“astounding affinities,” of which common stems
are purest in Quichua, so that the human race seems to have emanated
from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_302" id="page_302">{302}</a></span> tops of the Andes; similarities, too, between Peruvians and
the long-bearded Druids whose rites were chiefly sun-worship; they also
kept memoranda with strings tied in different knots, like the <i>quipus</i>,
and built vast structures of stone without tools. There are analogies
between Peruvians and Hindus, who worshipped the Sun as Rama and called
their first legislator Vaivasaonta, the Son of the Sun, and between Peru
and Farther India. The Seccos have been called the Malays of Bolivia.
There are analogies between Peruvians and Chinese, whose royal color was
also yellow, whose peculiar god from earliest times was the Sun, who
used <i>quipus</i>, who had terrace-cultivation and irrigation-systems like
those of the Incas, who used foot-messengers for royal emissaries, and
brought all the gold and silver of the realm for the beautifying of
royal temples. “The buildings, religious institutions, division of time,
and mystic notions,” which “seem in Asia to indicate the very dawn of
civilization,” are found here upon the Andes. Whether there was
intercommunication, or whether such facts merely suggest the instinctive
discovery of all peoples, their origin is wrapped only in mystery&mdash;a
veil whose lightest corner is only just lifting.</p>

<p>But to continue with the succeeding periods of history. Spanish
vice-regal days and the civil wars of the conquerors, the fleets of
treasure, the Inquisition, have been the subject of romantic histories.
Besides Prescott’s well-loved <i>Conquest of Peru</i>, William Robertson’s
<i>History of America</i>, published more than a century ago, gives a
concise, general survey since the Conquest. Drake’s <i>Worlde Encompassed</i>
and Southey’s account of Drake’s voyage in his <i>English Seamen</i>, as well
as Froude’s, together with various Hakluyt publications, are authorities
for freebooter days. Also there are such cold authorities as the
Calendars of State Papers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_303" id="page_303">{303}</a></span> many countries, E. Armstrong’s <i>The
Emperor Charles V</i>, and for the Inquisition, H. C. Lea, Vicuna Mackenna,
and Ricardo Palma. The reports to the Royal Council of the Indies of the
sixteenth century enter into minute details. Father Acosta was the
historian of the third council. His <i>Historia Natural y Moral de las
Indias</i>, first published in 1590, is an indispensable book, although it
has borne the reproach of being superficial.</p>

<p>The French Academicians came to Quito in 1735 to measure an arc of
meridian, an enterprise which d’Alembert considered the greatest ever
attempted by science. One of these scientists, La Condamine, made
extensive studies in quinine, named cinchona for the Countess of
Chinchón, vice-queen, and one of the first to feel its beneficent power.
His <i>Voyage fait dans l’Intérieur de l’Amérique Méridionale</i> (1745), and
the <i>Voyage Historique de l’Amérique Méridionale</i> by Antonio y Jorje
Juan de Ulloa (Spanish edition in 1748, French in 1752), who accompanied
the French expedition, both aim at truthfulness. Another delightful as
well as dependable work of the eighteenth century is the <i>Voyage dans la
Mer du Sud</i> by Amédée François Frézier (1716). In particular must be
mentioned Lozano’s <i>Histoire des Tremblements de Terre arrivés à Lima</i>.
Hales of the Royal Society of London has added to this French edition of
1752 accounts of Lima in his day, trustworthy as his observations on the
geology and meteorology of the coast.</p>

<p>Such facts as I have stated in regard to the natural history of the
coast are vouched for by Ferdinand von Hochstetter, <i>Die Erdbebenfluth
im Pazifischen Ocean</i>, Friedrich Goll, <i>Die Erdbeben Chiles</i>, a remote
work on <i>El Desierto de Atacama</i>, Humboldt’s <i>Vues des Cordillères</i>,
Darwin’s <i>Journal of Researches</i>, and the <i>Voyage of the Beagle</i>, the
three latter describing the natural history of the mountains as well.
One<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_304" id="page_304">{304}</a></span> or two of Sir Martin Conway’s books, Alfons Stübel, <i>Die
Vulkanberge von Ecuador</i>, and Neveu-Lemaire, <i>Les Lacs des Hauts
Plateaux de l’Amérique du Sud</i>, may also be added. In describing the
animals of Peru I have as authority Brehm’s <i>Thierleben</i>.</p>

<p>Ricardo Palma’s <i>Revista de Lima</i> and Carlos Romero’s <i>Revista Histórica
de Lima</i>, Manuel A. Fuentes’ <i>Estadística General de Lima</i>, published in
Paris in English as <i>Lima</i> in 1866, give interesting information in
regard to that city.</p>

<p>When it comes to the Amazonian wonderland no exaggeration could compete
with fact. But I have not withstood the temptation wholly on that
account! There is Louis Agassiz’ <i>A Journey in Brazil</i>, H. W. Bates’ <i>A
Naturalist on the River Amazon</i>, two books by Alfred Russel Wallace,
<i>Tropical Nature</i> and <i>Life on the Amazon</i>, Raimondi’s <i>El Departemento
de Loreto</i> as well as his <i>El Peru</i>, Robert Southey’s <i>History of
Brazil</i>, and the publications of the <i>Sociedad Geográfica de Lima</i>.</p>

<p>I am happy to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. Wilberforce Eames of
the New York Public Library for access to its <i>Americana</i>; to Dr. Martin
and to Dr. Stevenson of the <i>Hispanic Society of America</i>; to Mr. C. L.
Chester for many of my pictures; to Dr. F. S. Archenhold, Director of

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
